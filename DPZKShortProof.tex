\section{\name:MPC Friendly Zero Knowledge Argument from Interactive
PCP}\label{sec:graphene}
In this section, we describe a sub-linear interactive zero knowledge argument as
an Interactive PCP (IPCP). The IPCP we describe admits an efficient MPC to
convert it to a publicly-verifiable, non-interactive argument of knowledge,
using the ``BCS'' transformation in \cite{BCS16}.  \commentA{this part should move to the DPZK part}To serve as a
baseline for comparison, we also describe naive extensions of existing protocols
such as Bulletproofs \cite{bulletproofs}, Spartan \cite{spartan} to the
distributed prover setting. 

Our protocol proves membership in the $\npol$-complete
language specified by {\em rank one constraint system} (R1CS). An R1CS over a
field $\FF$ is specified by $M\times N$ matrices $A,B$ and $C$, where the
associated language $\mc{L}(A,B,C)$ consists of $\wit\in \FF^N$ such that
$A\wit\circ B\wit=C\wit$ \commentA{define the operation $\circ$}. We follow the broad outline of the interactive PCP
construction in \cite{ligero} which includes: (i) extending the witness, denoted as extended witness, to the concatenation of bits over all the wires in topological order of a Boolean circuit representing the statement   (ii) encoding the extended witness via suitable
error correcting code, (iii) checking linear relations on the extended witness (for the bits concerning the wires going into and coming out from the XOR gates), and 
(iv) checking quadratic relations on
the extended witness  (for the bits concerning the wires going into and coming out from the AND gates). Both the linear and quadratic checks require sub-linear (oracle) access to the 
witness encoding.
However, one runs into 
challenges in converting the IPCP to a non-interactive
argument when the witness is distributed across several provers. The naive
approach of provers sharing their encoded witnesses with an aggregator, which
constructs the oracle breaches privacy among the provers, as these encodings
only support {\em bounded independence}, i.e, they maintain privacy only when a
bounded part of the witness is revealed. We overcome this, and several other
technical challenges in our construction. The core techniques behind our
construction are summarized below:
\begin{itemize}
\item We use homomorphic commitment over witness encoding and provide oracle
access to the commitment. This facilitates oracle realization through
aggregation.
\item We design protocols for checking linear and quadratic constraints
with oracle access to the commitment.
\item We come up with new witness encoding scheme, to facilitate smaller
argument size, and reduce communication between the provers during proof
generation in the DPZK latter.
\end{itemize}
While our use of homomorphic commitments introduces expensive cryptographic
operations, we keep their usage strictly sub-linear. In particular, for an
argument size of $O(N^{1/c})$, the verifier and \commentA{keep away aggregator from SPZK. report aggregator's complexity in the DPZK section latter} the aggregator incur $O(N^{1-2/c})$
exponentiations. The prover incurs $O(N/\log N)$ exponentiations essentially while
setting up the oracle. We compare the concrete performance of our standalone SNARK with state of the art in Section
\ref{sec:snarkcomparison}.
