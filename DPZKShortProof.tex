\section{DPZK with reduced proof size}
An brief recall on how our paradigm enables any improvement in single prover ZK protocol directly translate to the DP version.

\subsection{Construction step 2: Skewing the witness matrix}
 ZK with $O(n^{1/c})$ proof size and $O(n^{1-1/c})$ pub key operations for
verifier.
 --- Using skewed matrix and inner product arguments.
