As mentioned earlier in the introduction, Pedersen \cite{Ped92} defines the
notion of distributed proof genration and proposes a generic construction using
MPC. Over the years, works have discussed distributed proof generation for a
restricted class of predicates: Desmedt et al. \cite{DDB94} proposing proofs for
graph isomorphism, various works \cite{King05, DDS, Desmedt2011} for proposing
threshold signatures, Keller et al. \cite{EfficientTZ} for a class of sigma
protocols. Bulletproof  \cite{bulletproofs} presents a
``distributed'' protocol to produce an aggregation of range proofs on inputs
held by different parties. However, their completeness property is weaker than
ours, i.e, a set of provers with valid witness can only prove the statement only if each input gate is exclusive to one prover. 
Trinocchio \cite{trinocchio} proposes a distributed proof generation method for
 Pinocchio  \cite{pinnochio_PHGR} but only when there is a
honest majority of semi-honest parties. Moreover, it needs the trusted setup
model. The work DIZK \cite{dizk} provides a distributed implementation of the proof generation of a non-interactive zero-knowledge protocol (zkSNARK).
 In Table ~\ref{tab:SPZK}, we compare the different metrics of efficiency for both the available $\DPZK$ protocols. Here $N$ is the size of the circuit and, $c$ is a positive integer of our choice. $\Num$ is the number provers in the $\DPZK$ setting. $M$ is to indicate the amount of computation required for a single multiplication on the field elements, and $E$ is to indicate the amount of computation required for single exponentiation on the group elements, in which $\mathsf{Dlog}$ is assumed to be hard. And $N_s$ denotes the size of the shared circuit.

%Ligero \cite{ligero}, a zero-knowledge protocol was given, which attains sublinear proof size, without any trusted setup and assuming that finding the collision for a hash function is difficult. Then in \cite{bulletproofs} zero-knowledge argument of logarithmic size without trusted setup, assuming the discrete log is hard. And then \cite{aurora} gave an IOP based protocol which is better than \cite{ligero} in terms of proof size, but not as good as \cite{bulletproofs}, but hardness assumption is a collision-resistant hash function. \cite{spartan} provides an argument which attains sublinear proof as well as sublinear verification, on the hardness assumption of the discrete log. Verification of \cite{bulletproofs} requires the exponentiation operation of linear order, which is very expensive in terms of practice. Whereas \cite{aurora} does not require exponentiation, but as all its messages are constructed as oracles, it takes too much memory in practice. \cite{spartan} is better in terms of verification. In our work, we provide a zero-knowledge protocol which has a sublinear proof size, same as \cite{spartan} and in verification number of required field operations is linear in size of the circuit but the number of exponentiations is very less, lesser than \cite{spartan}, in practice which can outperform all the above works.

%In \cite{DDS} notion of distributed prover protocol was introduced, where provers jointly provide a signature. Generalization of this work came in 2012 by Marcel et al. \cite{EfficientTZ}, which gave a generic notion of the distributed proof generation system. In this paper, the protocols were restricted to $\Sigma$-protocol.
%%Another contribution of our paper is to define the notion of distributed proof generation for zero-knowledge.
%In our work, we are revisiting the definition and providing an efficient protocol for general arithmetic circuits, which supports this notion. In \cite{bulletproofs}, it was given that the range proof supports the notion of distributed proof generation. In \cite{trinocchio}, a zero-knowledge protocol provided in \cite{pinnochio_PHGR} was converted into a distributed proof generation zero-knowledge protocol, but these protocols are based on the trusted setup. Later in this paper, we will describe how state-of-the-art zero-knowledge protocols lack efficiency while converting into distributed proof generation zero-knowledge protocol. \cite{spartan} requires an MPC of quadratic order in the size of the verification circuit. \cite{ligero, aurora} can not be transformed into $\DPZK$ directly. These works can be made $\DPZK$; in that case, the oracle constructions are needed to be changed such that it must have homomorphic property. This makes $\DPZK$ from \cite{aurora} very inefficient because every message in this protocol is constructed as an oracle. We describe a different approach to obtain $\DPZK$ from the inner product adapted from \cite{bulletproofs}.
