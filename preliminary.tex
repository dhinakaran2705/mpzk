\section{Preliminaries}
\subsection{Codes}
\paragraph{\textbf{Reed-Solomon Code:}} For positive integers $n,k$, finite field $\mathbb{F}$, and a vector $\eta = (\eta_1,\cdots ,\eta_n) \in \mathbb{F}_n$ of distinct field elements, the code $RS_{\mathbb{F},n,k,\eta}$ is the $[n,k,n-k+1]$ linear code over $\mathbb{F}$ that consists of all $n$-tuples $(p(\eta_1),...,p(\eta_n))$ where $p(\cdot)$ is a polynomial of degree $< k$ over $\mathbb{F}$.
\dnote{1. Have spaces between paragraphs even in Latex. The PDF generated by Latex is usually beautiful and readable. The tex file can't be beautiful but should atleast be as readable as the PDF.\\
2. I have already told you many time, and I am not going to leave till you use it :) Use macro for any notation that you use more than two times throughout the paper. (You will realize the use of it the day we decide change some notation in the middle of writing a paper.. But it is also a good practice to do it in general).\\
3.Use \ ldots for ...\\
4. You could use subsection* or subsubsection* instead of having a paragraph and using a textbf inside. (try both, what looks better depends on the cls file you use).}
\paragraph{\textbf{Interleaved Code:}} Let $L\subset \mathbb{F}_n$ be an $[n,k,d]$ linear code over $\mathbb{F}$. We let $L^m$ denote the $[n,mk,d]$ (interleaved) code over $\mathbb{F}^m$ whose code words are all $m\times n$ matrices $U$ such that every row $U_i$ of $U$ satisfies $U_i\in L$. For $U\in L^m$ and $j\in[n]$, we denote by $U[j]$ the $j^{th}$ symbol (column) of $U$.
\dnote{Have "th" in jth outside math mode.}

\subsection{Interactive Oracle Proofs} The Interactive Oracle Proofs is the notion which combine both Interactive Proofs and Probabilistically Checkable Proofs, and also generalize the notion of the Interactive PCPs.
\paragraph{} A $k$-round public-coin IOP has $k$ rounds of interaction. In the $i^{th}$ round of interaction, the verifier sends a uniformly random message $m_i$ to the prover; then the prover replies with a message $\pi_i$ to the verifier. After $k$ rounds of interaction, the verifier makes some queries to the oracles it received and either accepts or rejects.
\dnote{Have at least the main definitions in the Definition environment.}
\paragraph{} An IOP system for a relation $\mathcal{R}$ with round complexity $k$ and soundness error $\epsilon$ is a pair $(P, V )$, where $P, V$ are probabilistic algorithms, that satisfies the following properties:
\paragraph{\textit{Completeness:}}  For every instance-witness pair $(x,w)$ in the relation $\mathcal{R}, (P (x, w), V (x))$ is a $k(n)$-round interactive oracle protocol with accepting probability 1.
\paragraph{\textit{Soundness:}} For every instance $x \notin \mathcal{L(R)}$ and unbounded malicious prover $P^*, (P^*, V (x))$ is a $k(n)$-round interactive oracle protocol with accepting probability at most $\epsilon(n)$.
\subsection{Zero-Knowledge} 
\paragraph{\textbf{Interactive Argument Systems:}} A pair of PPT(Probabilistic Polynomial Time) interactive machines $<P, V>$ is called an interactive proof system for a language $\mathcal{L}$ if there exists a negligible function $negl(\cdot)$ such that the following two conditions hold:
\dnote{1. have space before a ( or any other bracket.\\
2. Use \ langle and \ rangle instead of < and > when using it as brackets.
3. You can have negl in mathsf, it would look better (have a macro for this too!)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(1)] \textit{Completeness:} For every $x\in \mathcal{L}$ there exists a string $w$ such that for every $z \in \{0,1\}^*$,
$Pr[<P(x,w),V(x,z)>=1] \geq 1-negl(|x|)$.
	\item[(2)] \textit{Soundness:} For every $x \notin \mathcal{L}$, every interactive PPT machine $P^*$, and every $w,z\in \{0,1\}^*$ $Pr[<P^*(x,w),V(x,z)>=1]\leq negl(|x|)$ 
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{\textbf{Zero Knowledge:}} Let$<P,V>$ be an interactive proof system for some language $\mathcal{L}$. We say that $<P,V>$ is computational zero-knowledge with respect to an auxiliary input if for every PPT interactive machine $V^*$ there exists a PPT algorithm $S$, running in time polynomial in the length of its first input, such that $\{<P(x,w),V^*(x,z)>\}_{x\in \mathcal{L},w\in \mathcal{R}_x,z\in \{0,1\}^*}\approx_c \{<S(x,z)>\}_{x\in\mathcal{L},z\in\{0,1\}^*}$
\subsection{Commitment schemes} 
\paragraph{\textbf{Commitemnts:}} A non-interactive commitment scheme consists of a pair of probabilistic polynomial time algorithms $(Setup,Com)$. The setup algorithm $pp\leftarrow Setup(1^{\lambda})$ generates public parameters $pp$ for the scheme, for security parameter $\lambda$. The commitment algorithm $Com_{pp}$ defines a function $M_{pp} \times R_{pp} \rightarrow C_{pp}$ for message space $M_{pp}$, randomness space $R_{pp}$ and commitment space $C_{pp}$ determined by $pp$. For a message $x\in M_{pp}$, the algorithm draws $\delta \in_R  R_{pp}$ uniformly at random, and computes commitment $\com = Com_{pp}(x; \delta)$.\\
For ease of notation we write $Com = Com_{pp}$.
\dnote{All algorithm names in mathsf (macro for each). Eg. in the above paragraph, Setup, Com, ...}
\paragraph{\textbf{Homomorphic Commitment:}} A homomorphic commitment scheme is a non-interactive commitment scheme such that $M_{pp},R_{pp}$ and $C_{pp}$ are all abelian groups, and for all $x_1,x_2 \in M_{pp}, \delta_1,\delta_2 \in R_{pp}$, we have $Com(x_1; \delta_1) + Com(x_2; \delta_2) = Com(x_1 + x_2; \delta_1 + \delta_2)$
\dnote{Hiding and binding are the core properties of a commitment scheme, i.e., a definition of a commitment scheme includes the properties of hiding and binding. So bring them first. And just mention ``Hiding'' and ``Binding''.}
\paragraph{\textbf{Hiding Commitment:}} A commitment scheme is said to be hiding if for all PPT adversaries $\Adv$ there exists a negligible function $\mu(\lambda)$ such that
$$ |Pr[b=b'|pp\leftarrow Setup(1^{\lambda}); (x_0,x_1)\in M^2_{pp}\leftarrow \Adv(pp), b\in_R\{0,1\}, \delta \in_R R_{pp}, \com=Com(x_b;\delta), b'\leftarrow \Adv(pp,com)]-\frac{1}{2}|\leq \mu(\lambda)$$
\paragraph{\textbf{Binding Commitment:}} A commitment scheme is said to be binding if for all PPT adversaries $\Adv$ there exists a negligible function $\mu$ such that 
$$Pr[Com(x_0;\delta_0)=Com(x_1,\delta_1) \wedge x_0\neq x_1| pp\leftarrow Setup(1^{\lambda})x_0,x_1,\delta_0, \delta_1\leftarrow \Adv(pp)]\leq \mu(\lambda)$$
\dnote{Have a subsection* with Pedersen commitment, and have the vector commitment also in the same part.}
\paragraph{\textbf{Pedersen Commitment:}} $M_{pp}, R_{pp} = \mathbb{Z}_p, C_{pp} = \mathbb{G}$ of order $p$.\\
$Setup : g, h \in_R \mathbb{G}$\\
$Com(x,\delta)=(g^xh^{\delta})$
\paragraph{\textbf{Pedersen Vector Commitment:}} $M_{pp}= \mathbb{Z}^n_p , R_{pp} = \mathbb{Z}_p, C_{pp}= \mathbb{G}$ with G of order p.\\ 
$Setup: \vc{g}=(g_1,\cdots,g_n),h \in_R \mathbb{G}$\\
$Com(\vc{x} = (x_1,\cdots,x_n);\delta) = h^r\vc{g}^{\vc{x}} = h^r \prod\limits_i g_i^{x_i} \in \mathbb{G}$
