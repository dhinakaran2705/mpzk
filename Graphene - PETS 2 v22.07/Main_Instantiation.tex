%---------
In this section, we present the distributed proof generation from various protocols. We start with Ligero~\cite{ligero}, where we discuss the efficiency of the distributed prover variant. We optimize the protocol and provide a zero-knowledge protocol, named $\name$, that achieves better proof size, verification time, and reduced communication among the provers. We explain the high-level idea of $\name$ and provide the details of the construction in Appendix~\ref{app:grapehene_securityproofs}. The distributed version of $\name$ is given in Appendix~\ref{app:dp_grapehene_securityproofs}.
We move on to the state-of-the-art IOP-based zero-knowledge protocol Aurora~\cite{aurora}. We discuss the efficiency of the compiled version of Aurora that enables distributed proof generation. This multi-oracle IOP shows the overhead of the compilation. 
We also discuss distributed proof generation from non-IOP protocols such as Bulletproofs~\cite{bulletproofs} and Spartan~\cite{spartan}. We study the efficiency and challenges of the distributed prover variant of these protocols. 


%In Ligero~\cite{ligero}, an extended witness is viewed as a matrix of size $O(\sqrt{N}) \times O(\sqrt{N})$. To do that, first $\ell$ entries are set as the first row of the matrix, next $\ell$ entries form the second row and so on. This way a matrix is formed which has, say $m$ rows and $\ell$ columns, where $m = \ell = O(\sqrt{N})$. We are calling this as canonical matrix form. 
%Then each row of the matrix is encoded. Then in that protocol, the prover is required to communicate messages, one of which is the size of a row and $O(1)$ many columns of the encoded extended witness. This imposes a natural restriction on Ligero as they cannot skew the dimensions to reduce the proof size. Among the two dimensions, the largest dimension becomes the dominating factor that makes $\sqrt{N}$ is the best achievable communication complexity in Ligero. This bottleneck was resolved in Ligero++~\cite{ligero++}. They replace the communication of one dimension by using the inner product argument. More precisely, they rely on the inner product argument proposed in Virgo~\cite{Virgo}, which in turn relies on the Aurora proof system. Our optimization over Ligero is in a similar direction. We present the extended witness as a cube (3D matrix). One extra dimension brings more flexibility to a better trade-off between the communication complexity and the verification time. The key differences from Ligero/Ligero++ are the following.
%(i) We use bulletproofs based inner product argument on reducing the communication complexity, and also, this is mainly used to facilitate distributed prover version that others fail to achieve.
%(ii) We split the extended witness into three dimensions that aids in verification time while retaining the communication complexity proportional to the smallest dimension.

\subsection{Protocols with single oracle}
\paragraph*{D-Ligero:}
We compile the Ligero protocol, and we instantiate the functional commitment scheme $\FC$ by Pedersen vector commitment scheme. Note that this $\FC$ has homomorphic property and the $\open$ algorithm outputs the committed value ${\bf m}$ as the witness. $\verif$ algorithm can be replaced by an inner product argument where ${\bf m}$ is the witness.
%----

The proof for an R1CS instance in Ligero constitutes of the check if the witness $\wit$ satisfies the following condition: $x = A \wit \land y = B \wit \land z = C \wit \land x \circ y = z$, where is $A, B, C$ matrices are dependent on the R1CS instance. The above check is segmented into three checks: (i) Interleaved check, (ii) Linear check, and (iii) Quadratic check. 
%---

In Ligero, $\prover$ rewrites the vectors $\wit, x, y, z$ as matrices in a canonical way, that is, first $\ell$ entries are set as the first row of the matrix, next $\ell$ entries form the second row and so on. This way a matrix is formed which has, say $m$ rows and $\ell$ columns, where $m = \ell = O(\sqrt{N})$. We are calling this a canonical matrix form. The prover encodes these matrices using RS-encoding by encoding each row of the matrices.
In the compiled Ligero protocol, $\prover$ computes commitment in each column of these matrices. The commitment scheme takes $m$ length messages. In the original Ligero protocol, $t$ (depends on the query complexity) many columns and a linear combination of the rows are opened to the verifier. This enforces a bound on the proof size in Ligero. We circumvent this bound by replacing the openings with inner product checks. 
%---------------

In the interleaved check, $\prover$ proves that the rows of the oracle matrices are codewords. $\prover$ proves the claim probabilistically by showing a random linear combination of the rows is a code word. The $\verifier$ uniformly picks the coefficients for the linear combination.
Therefore, if one or more rows in the matrices are not correct codewords, then the linear combination is not a codeword with high probability. Furthermore, $\verifier$ queries the oracle with few indices (the number of queries is bounded by the security parameter $t$ for zero-knowledge) and receives the corresponding columns. Upon receiving the columns, $\verifier$ performs the same linear combination and checks with the row received from $\prover$.
%---
In the linear check, $\prover$ proves the knowledge of a vector $x$ such that $Ax = b$ holds for public matrix $A$ and vector $b$. This check is reduced to a probabilistic check $r^TAx = r^T b$, where $r$ is a random vector picked by $\verifier$. $\prover$ computes a polynomial $p(x)$ such that the sum of the evaluations on publicly known points is equal to $r^Tb$, and sends this $p(x)$ to $\verifier$. $\verifier$ checks if the above condition holds or not, it further checks if $p(x)$ is constructed correctly from $r, A$, and $\wit$. $\verifier$ validates this by querying some locations of the oracle.
%---
In the quadratic check, $\prover$ proves that $x \circ y = z$, where the corresponding encoded values are set as oracles. $\verifier$ gives a randomly sampled challenge vector $r$ to $\prover$. $\prover$ constructs a polynomial $p(x)$ using $r$ and the encoding polynomials of $x, y, z$. This polynomial should evaluate to $0$ on publicly known points. $\prover$ sends the polynomial $p(x)$ to $\verifier$. Upon receiving $p(x)$, $\verifier$ checks if the above condition is true or not. Furthermore, it checks if $p(x)$ is correctly constructed or not. For this, it queries some locations of the oracles.
%---

In the compiled protocol, $\verifier$ obtains commitment corresponding to the queried columns, and instead of sending the openings of those columns, we perform the inner product argument. In this protocol, the opening of the columns is not sent. Therefore we can elongate the size of the columns. This approach reduces the row size. The inner product argument requires $O(\log N)$ size communication, where $N$ is the size of the witness vector. Therefore the newly obtained protocol has proof size $O(\ell + \log (m))$, where $\ell$ is the size of the row, and $m$ is the size of the column. However, verifying these inner products requires $O(N)$ exponentiations for a $N$ sized witness vector. Thus increasing the column size too much may give a better proof size but increases the verification time, which is undesirable.
Furthermore, for the quadratic check protocol, the polynomial $p(x)$ depends non-linearly on the witness since it requires multiplication of the polynomials used for encoding $x, y$. Therefore, provers in $\Partyset$ engage in a secure computation where they obtain an additive sharing of $p(x)$. In general, this incurs a communication for computing a circuit of depth $1$ with $O(N)$ multiplications. Nevertheless, if the size of the shared circuit is sufficiently low (smaller than the row size in the canonical matrix), then it is possible to embed the shared circuit in a row. In that case, MPC is required only for the row that contains the shared circuit.

%------------------------------------------------------------
%
%Similarly, for Ligero~\cite{ligero}, Ligero++~\cite{ligero++}, our compiler provides protocols with  prover time $O(N\log N)$ field multiplication plus $O(N)$ group exponentiations, and verification time $O(N)$ field multiplication plus $O(N)$ group exponentiations. Note that the proof size of the protocols remains the same in the new compiled protocols. We call the distributed versions as D-Ligero and D-Ligero++ respectively. Since Ligero++ uses inner product of Virgo, which is similar to Aurora, therefore D-Ligero++ is similar to D-Aurora.
%%---
%
%From the above compiler, we see how we can obtain a secure DPZK protocol from Ligero. In the compiled protocol, we observe that each entry of the oracle is committed. Therefore the oracle size remains the same as the oracle size of the base Ligero protocol. However, this can be optimized further, and this optimization aids in reducing the proof size by overcoming the bottleneck of $O(\sqrt{N})$.
%%--- 
%
%The proof for an R1CS instance in Ligero constitutes of the check if the witness $\wit$ satisfies the following condition: $x = A \wit \land y = B \wit \land z = C \wit \land x \circ y = z$, where is $A, B, C$ matrices are dependent on the R1CS instance. The above check is segmented into three checks: (i) Interleaved check, (ii) Linear check, and (iii) Quadratic check. 
%%---
%
%In Ligero, $\prover$ rewrites the vectors $\wit, x, y, z$ as matrices in a canonical way, further encodes these matrices using RS-encoding by encoding each row of the matrices. Finally, it sets each column of these matrices as oracles. The oracle in Ligero is a matrix, and each location of the oracle contains a column of the matrix.
%%---
%In the interleaved check, $\prover$ proves that the rows of the oracle matrices are codewords. To do that, it provides a random linear combination of the rows of the matrices, where the coefficients for the linear combination are picked by $\verifier$. Therefore, if one or more rows in the matrices are not correct codewords, then the linear combination is not a codeword with high probability. Furthermore, $\verifier$ queries the oracle with few indices (the number of queries is bounded by the security parameter $t$ for zero-knowledge) and receives the corresponding columns. Upon receiving the columns, $\verifier$ performs the same linear combination and checks with the row received from $\prover$.
%%---
%In the linear check, $\prover$ proves the knowledge of a vector $x$ such that $Ax = b$ holds for public matrix $A$ and vector $b$. This check is reduced to a probabilistic check $r^TAx = r^T b$, where $r$ is a random vector picked by $\verifier$. $\prover$ computes a polynomial $p(x)$ such that the sum of the evaluations on publicly known points is equal to $r^Tb$, and sends this $p(x)$ to $\verifier$. $\verifier$ checks if the above condition holds or not, it further checks if $p(x)$ is constructed correctly from $r, A$, and $\wit$. To check this, $\verifier$ queries some locations of the oracle.
%%---
%In the quadratic check, $\prover$ proves that $x \circ y = z$, where the corresponding encoded values are set as oracles. $\verifier$ gives a randomly sampled challenge vector $r$ to $\prover$. $\prover$ constructs a polynomial $p(x)$ using the challenge $r$ and the polynomials used in the encoding of $x, y, z$. This polynomial should evaluate to $0$ on publicly known points. $\prover$ sends the polynomial $p(x)$ to $\verifier$. Upon receiving $p(x)$, $\verifier$ checks if the above condition is true or not. Furthermore, it checks if $p(x)$ is correctly constructed or not. For this, it queries some locations of the oracles.
%%---
%
%In D-Ligero, each entry of each oracle is committed using Pedersen commitment. $\verifier$ receives the committed values of all the entries corresponding to the queried locations in each column.
%%---
%Observe that, in this construction, we can replace the Pedersen commitment with the Pedersen vector commitment. Instead of committing to individual entries separately, we can commit to each column separately. Now, corresponding to a column, there is only one commitment, which gives an oracle, a row vector. With this modification, the verification algorithm does not change. Therefore soundness and zero-knowledge remain unaffected.
%%---  
%We further leverage the commitment scheme by using inner product arguments instead of opening columns. With this modification, we overcome the bottleneck of $O(\sqrt{N})$. This idea is in line with Ligero++. We use the inner product argument from Bulletproofs.
%%---
%
%For Interleaved check, $\verifier$ receives commitments of the chosen columns by the oracle. The linear combination check on the columns can be viewed as $\innp{r}{c}$, where $r$ is the challenge vector chosen by $\verifier$, and $c$ is the column. $\verifier$ knows the vector $r$ and the commitment of $c$, $\prover$ knows both $r$ and $c$. $\prover$ and $\verifier$ deterministically computes a commitment of $r$, then $\prover$ uses $r, c$ as a witness for the corresponding inner product argument. Note that the above setting is the same as bulletproofs inner product argument.
%%---
%For Linear check, $\verifier$ receives the polynomial $p(x)$, where $p(x) = \sum_i s_i(x) f_i(x)$, where $f_i(x)$ is the polynomial used in encoding $i$th row of $x$ and $s_i(\zeta_j) = R_{ij}$, where $R$ is the canonical matrix form of the vector $R = r^TA$ and $\zeta$'s are publicly known points used for encoding (the interpolation domain). $\verifier$ evaluates $p(x)$ on $\zeta$'s and checks if it sums up to $r^Tb$. Furthermore, it needs to check if $p(x)$ is well-formed or not, i.e. $p(\eta_j) = \sum_i s_i(\eta_j) \ewit[i,j]$, where $\eta$'s are the public points used in encoding (evaluation point), and $\ewit[\cdot,j]$ is the $j$th column in the oracle matrix. This check can be viewed as $p(\eta_j) = \innp{s_j}{\ewit[\cdot,j]}$, where $s_j = (s_1(\eta_j), \ldots, s_m(\eta_j))$, considering $m$ as the number of rows. Similar to the interleaved check, we check this using bulletproofs inner product argument.
%%---
%For Quadratic check, consider, $f^x_i(x), f^y_i(x), f^z_i(x)$ are the polynomials used in encoding of $x, y, z$ and $\ewit^x[\cdot,j], \ewit^y[\cdot,j], \ewit^z[\cdot, j]$ are the $j$ the columns of the oracles corresponding to $x, y, z$. Similar to the linear check, $\zeta$'s, $\eta$'s are the set of points used for interpolation and evaluation in the encoding respectively.  $\verifier$ gives a random vector $r$ as a challenge to $\prover$. $\prover$ computes $p(x) = \sum_i r_i [ f^x_i (x) \cdot f^y_i(x) - f^z_i(x)]$ and sends $p(x)$ to $\verifier$. Note that $p(\zeta_j) = 0$, $\verifier$ checks this. To ensure the correct computation of $p(x)$, $\verifier$ checks $p(\eta_j) = \sum_i r_i [ \ewit^x[i,j] \cdot \ewit^y[\cdot,j] - \ewit^z[\cdot,j]]$. This can be viewed as $p(\eta_j) = \innp{r}{(\ewit^x[\cdot,j] \cdot \ewit^y[\cdot,j] - \ewit^z[\cdot,j])}$. Unfortunately, we cannot use bulletproofs inner product argument directly here, since the commitment of $\ewit^x[\cdot,j] \cdot \ewit^y[\cdot,j]$ is not available to $\verifier$. To use inner product argument, we see the above equation as follows:
%%----
%\begin{align*}
%p(x) & = \innp{r}{(\ewit^x[\cdot,j] \cdot \ewit^y[\cdot,j] - \ewit^z[\cdot,j])} \\
%& = \innp{r}{(\ewit^x[\cdot,j] \cdot \ewit^y[\cdot,j])} - \innp{r}{\ewit^z[\cdot,j]} \\
%& = \innp{(r \circ \ewit^x[\cdot,j])}{ \ewit^y[\cdot,j]} - \innp{r}{\ewit^z[\cdot,j]} \\
%& = \innp{(r \circ \ewit^x[\cdot,j] || r)}{(  \ewit^y[\cdot,j] || - \ewit^z[\cdot,j])} \\
%\end{align*}
%%----
%Since, $r$ is available to both $\prover$ and $\verifier$ and the commitments of $ \ewit^x[\cdot,j],  \ewit^y[\cdot,j],  \ewit^z[\cdot,j]$ are available to both $\prover$ and $\verifier$. They obtain the commitments of both $(r \circ \ewit^x[\cdot,j] || r)$ and $ (\ewit^y[\cdot,j] || - \ewit^z[\cdot,j] )$ and perform the inner product check.
%%----
%Let $\epsilon_L$ and $\epsilon_B$ be the soundness error of Ligero and Bulletproofs inner product argument, respectively. Then, the modified protocol's soundness error is $O(\epsilon_L + \epsilon_B)$. However, zero-knowledge remains unharmed since, in the modified protocol, the verifier is not learning anything additional. 
%%----
%Note that in the modified protocol, we can elongate the column size and shorten the row size. Let the row size be $n$, and the column size be $m$, then the proof size is $O(n + \log (m))$ since the proof size of the inner product argument in bulletproofs is $\log (N)$ for $N$ sized vector.
%%---
%However, setting $m$ to be arbitrarily large increases verification time. 
%%---
%To obtain better proof size and verification time simultaneously, we optimize further by adjoining an additional dimension. The details are given in Section~\ref{sec:graphenec}.

%----
%We provide construction of a new proof system which can be obtained from Ligero/Ligero++~\cite{ligero,ligero++} using our compiler and some additional optimization. The rationale behind opting for Ligero style proof system is that it does not have many oracles. Therefore the conversion is less costly.
%%----
%Using the compiler directly on Ligero++~\cite{ligero++} gives 2D version of our construction where the Virgo~\cite{Virgo} inner product is replaced by Bulletproofs~\cite{bulletproofs} inner product. We optimize further in our construction by adjoining additional dimension which aids in better trade-off between proof size and verification time. 
%----
\paragraph*{\name:}
We use a similar approach to~\cite{bootle2020linear, bootle2020zero}, where the witness is viewed as a multi-dimensional matrix. In our construction, we restrict to 3 dimensions since, among these dimensions, only the smallest one contributes to the proof size, while the remaining two aid in better verification time. Moreover, constructions with higher dimensions require more rounds and oracles. We opt Ligero-style protocol because it has very few rounds, and the number of oracles is also significantly less, which helps to obtain an efficient DPZK. The protocols with higher dimensions may lose efficiency.
%----
In our setting, we explored the scenarios by increasing the number of dimensions. Those approaches lead to more complicated and costlier proof-generation and verification protocols without any more improvements. \cite{bootle2020zero} provides linear-time prover with poly-logarithmic verification, but a major drawback of this work is that the soundness error is $O(1)$. Furthermore,~\cite{bootle2020linear} obtain linear-time prover by using linear-time encodable codes. For that, they use a linear code provided by~\cite{druk2014linear}, whose decoding is conjectured intractable. Due to this property, ~\cite{bootle2020linear} does not satisfy the proof of knowledge property.
%----

In \name, we follow the same approach of Ligero. We start with the extended witness $\wit$, consider it as a 3 dimensional matrix of size $p \times m \times s$ where $p$ many 2 dimensional matrices of size $m \times s$, called a slice, stacked one after another. In contrast to Ligero, where each row is encoded separately, we encode each slice separately. 
Setting, $\ell = s + \bi$, $h > 2m$, $n > 2\ell$ where $\bi$ is the bounded independence parameter depending on the query complexity. We consider ${\bm \zeta} = \{ \zeta_1, \ldots, \zeta_{\ell}\}$, ${\bm \eta} = \{\eta_1, \ldots, \eta_{n}\}$ and ${\bm \alpha} = \{ \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_h \}$ public set of points where $G = \{(\alpha_j,\zeta_k) : j \in [m],k \in [\ell] \}$ and $H = \{(\alpha_j,\eta_k) : j \in [h],k \in [n] \}$ are defined as the interpolation domain and evaluation domain for the encoding respectively. To encode the $i$th slice, we construct a bivariate polynomial $Q^i(x,y)$ such that $Q^i(\alpha_j,\zeta_k) = \wit[i,j,k]$ and $\deg_x(Q^i) < m$ and $\deg_y(Q^i) < \ell$.
The encoded witness $\ewit$ is such that $\ewit[i,j,k] = Q^i(\alpha_j,\eta_k)$ for $i\in[p], j\in[h], k\in[n]$. Then each column of each slice is committed using Pedersen vector commitment. Here we instantiate the homomorphic $\FC$ with the Pedersen commitment scheme with message length $h$. Finally, the committed matrix is send to which $\verifier$ has oracle access. 
Note that due to the homomorphic property of the commitment scheme, the interleaved check can be delegated on some committed values. 
For linear check, similar to Ligero, a probabilistic reduction is performed. $\verifier$ sends a random $r$ and both $\prover$ and $\verifier$ locally compute $R = r^TA$. Using ${\bm \alpha, \zeta}$ they obtain $p$ many polynomials $R^i(x,y)$ such that $R^i(\alpha_j, \zeta_k) = R[i,j,k]$ for $i\in[p], j\in[m], k\in[s]$ and $\deg_x(R^i) < m$, $\deg_y(R^i) < s$ for all $i$. $\prover$ computes polynomial $p_j(y) = \sum_{i\in[p]} R^i(\alpha_j, y) Q^i(\alpha_j, y)$. If the witness is correct then $r^TA\wit = r^Tb \Rightarrow \innp{R}{\wit} = r^T b \Rightarrow \sum_{j\in [m], k\in [s]} p_j (\zeta_k) = r^Tb$. Furthermore, $p_j(\eta_k) = \sum_{i\in[p]} R^i(\alpha_j, \eta) \ewit[i,j,k]$ due to the encoding. $\prover$ constructs a matrix $P$ of size $h \times n$ such that $P[j,k] = p_j(\eta)$ and commits to $P$. By providing partial opening using inner product arguments from bulletproofs, $\prover$ probabilistically proves that the polynomials $p_j(y)$ satisfies the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
	%----
	\item $p_j(\eta_k) = \sum_{i\in[p]} R^i(\alpha_j, \eta) \ewit[i,j,k]$ for all $j \in [h], k \in [n]$
	%----
	\item $\sum_{j\in [m], k\in [s]} p_j (\zeta_k) = r^Tb$
	%----
\end{itemize}

Similar to the linear check, in the quadratic check, $\prover$ encodes $x,y,z$ to obtain $\ewit_x, \ewit_y, \ewit_z$ and let $Q^i_x, Q^i_y, Q^i_z$ are the respective polynomials. $\prover$ constructs polynomials $Q^i$ such that $Q^i = Q^i_x\cdot Q^i_y - Q^i_z$. Since $x\circ y = z$, therefore $Q^i(\alpha_j,\zeta_k) = 0$ for all $i\in[p], j\in[m], k\in[s]$. To check this, $\verifier$ sends a random vector $r\in \FF^p$ as a challenge. $\prover$ locally computes $p_j(\cdot) = \sum_{i \in [p]} r_i Q^(\alpha_j, \cdot)$. Analogous to the linear check, $\prover$ forms $P$ matrix and commits to it, further it proves that $P$ satisfies the following:
\begin{itemize}
	%----
	\item $p_j(\eta_k) = \sum_{i\in[p]} r^i [\ewit_x[i,j,k] \cdot \ewit_y[i,j,k] - \ewit_z[i,j,k]$ for all $j \in [h], k \in [n]$
	%----
	\item $p_j (\zeta_k) = 0$ for all $j \in [m], k \in [s]$
	%----
\end{itemize}
%----

To obtain $DP-\name$, parties in $\Partyset$ execute secure multiplication to get an additive sharing of $\ewit_x[i,j,k] \cdot \ewit_y[i,j,k]$. The rest of the other steps in both linear and quadratic checks require no more interaction among the provers. Therefore, the provers interact to evaluate a circuit with $O(N)$ many multiplications with depth $1$. However, with smaller shared circuit where the shared circuit can be embedded into a column of a slice. Then multiplication only for that column is required. 
The details of the protocol are given in Section~\ref{app:grapehene_securityproofs}.


\subsection{Multiple oracle IOP}
\paragraph*{D-Aurora:}
In Aurora~\cite{aurora}, the size of the oracle is $O(N)$, the proof size is $O(\log^2 N)$, and number of rounds is $O(\log N)$. Aurora is an IOP-based proof system where almost all the messages from $\prover$ to $\verifier$ are set as oracles, and $\verifier$ makes oracle-queries to complete the verification.
%----
We can convert Aurora using our compiler such that it supports DPZK, we call the distributed version to be D-Aurora. The compiled version retains the Oracle size, proof size, and number of rounds. However, the prover time and the verification time increase by $O(N\log N)$ group exponentiations. Since all the oracle construction and validation need $O(N)$ group exponentiations in every round. The distributed version of it needs secure evaluation of circuits with at least depth one and $O(N)$ multiplication gates in each round.
%----
\subsection{Non-IOP protocols}
\paragraph*{Bulletproofs:}
In Bulletproofs~\cite{bulletproofs}, the proof of an R1CS instance is reduced to an inner product argument which is proved recursively for the succinctness of the proof size. 
%----
Prover constructs two vector polynomials $l(X), r(X)$ of degree $1$ using witness, statement and challenges from the verifier. It commits to the quadratic polynomial $t(X) = \innp{l(X)}{r(X)}$ where $t(X) = \sum_{i=0}^{d} \sum_{j=0}^{i} \innp{l_i}{r_j} X^{i+j}$, where $l_i$ and $r_j$ are $l(X)$'s $i$th and $r(X)$'s $j$th vector coefficients respectively.
%----
The verifier sends a random point $x$ for evaluation and prover obtains ${\bm l} = l(x)$, ${\bm r} = r(x)$ and $t = t(x)$. Using inner product argument it proves that $\innp{{\bm l}}{{\bm r}} = t$.

In D-Bulletproofs, provers start with an additive sharing of the witness and locally obtain additive sharing of $l(X), r(X)$. Parties in $\Partyset$ perform secure multiplications to obtain additive sharing of $t(X)$. This requires $O(N)$ multiplications. Upon receiving $x$ from the verifier, each prover locally gets sharing of ${\bm l,\bm r}, t$ and sends these values to the aggregator. The aggregator performs the inner product argument with the verifier to complete the proof.

\paragraph*{Spartan:}
In Spartan~\cite{spartan}, an R1CS circuit is represented by 3 matrices $A, B, C$. A witness $\wit$ for the true instance satisfies $Az  \circ Bz = Cz$, where $z = (io, 1, \wit)$ for public input $io$. In Spartan, prover obtains low-degree polynomial extensions of $A, B, C, z$. Upon receiving the challenges from the verifier, the prover constructs a polynomial $\calG_{io,\tau}$. Then sum-check is performed on $\calG_{io,\tau}$, that is, $\sum_{x\in\{0,1\}^s} \calG_{io,\tau} = 0$, where $s = O(\log (N))$. For zero knowledge, checks are performed exponents.

For the distributed proof generation, provers initiate the protocol with an additive sharing of the witness $\wit$ and to achieve an additive sharing of $\calG_{io,\tau}$ parties in $\Partyset$ perform secure MPC, which requires $O(N^2)$ multiplication. Furthermore, to manage privacy among the provers and zero-knowledge, operations must be executed over exponent, and we do not have a proof for privacy. 

The above discussion further emphasizes the non-triviality of obtaining DPZK from any zero-knowledge protocol.
