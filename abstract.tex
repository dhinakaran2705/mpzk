%	Zero knowledge is an intriguing area of research from the prospect of theory as well as application, where a party, prover \textit{P}, tries to convince verifier \textit{V} that a statement $x$( instance of an NP language) is correct using a witness $w$ such that $M(x,w)=1$. Let $C$ be the circuit representation of $M$ and $|C|$ is the size of $C$ i.e. the no. of gates in $C$. The work of Ligero in this problem proposed a solution where proof size is $O(|C|^{1/2})$. They solve the problem by converting a NP language to it's corresponding circuit satisfiability problem. $w\in \mathbb{F}^{ml}$ be the extended witness which is the secret input to the prover. Prover \textit{P} encodes $w$ to a matrix $U$ of size $m\times n$, where $m, n, l = O(\sqrt{|C|})$ and $n>l$. In Ligero's protocol first check is for to ensure that the matrix $U$ is a correct encoding, that is done by testing interleaved. Then they check that all the outcomes of all the gates( addition and multiplication) are correct or not, and to do that they introduce two checks, linear constraint and quadratic constraint. We are using the same approach of Ligero, but our encoding is different. Instead of matrix we will encode $w$ to a box( matrix of 3 dimensions), to keep the familiarity of notation we will consider $w\in \mathbb{F}^{pml}$ and the size of the box $U$ is $p\times m\times n$, where $p, m, n, l = O(\sqrt[3]{|C|})$ and $n>l$. To encode $w$ we are going to construct $pm$ many polynomials(univariate) such that each of them has degree at most $s$, where $s$ is some suitable number between $l$ and $n$.

%\mycomment{Adding a version below.}
%The work of Ligero[citation] proposed ... In Ligero, a witness $x$ is encoded into a matrix $U$ of dimension $m \times n$, where $m$ and $n$ denote - and - respectively. Our idea is similar to theirs apart from the witness being encoded to a {\em box}. A box is a 3-dimensional matrix ($m \times n \times p$) where --(add technical details of box here). This ensures linearity of (what?) along both rows and columns. We hope that the aforementioned encoding along with homomorphic commitments lead to a ZK proof, whose size will be $O(|C|^{\frac{1}{3}})$.
