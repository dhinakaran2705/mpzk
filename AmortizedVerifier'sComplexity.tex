\section{Amortized Verifier's complexity:}

For our construction, verifier's complexity for Interleaved Testing and Quadratic Testing is already sublinear, main bottle-neck for verifier's complexity is due to linear check.
Now we will discuss one by one, all the checks that verifier needs to do for the linearity constraint.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Validation check for $C[k]$ with respect to $c$: 
	\item $\sum\limits_{k\in[l]} q(\zeta_k) = \overline{r}^T b$: since for the linear check in our protocol, we wilkl always have the public vecto $b=0$, so only operations that the verifier will do is to evaluate the polynomial $q(\cdot)$ in $l$ many public points, that needs $l\cdot (s_l-1)$ many field operations, since degree of the polynomial $q(\cdot)$ is $<s+l-1$.
	\item $\langle 1^m , \oq[j'] \rangle = q(\eta_{j'})$ $\forall j'\in [h]$: For this proof of inner product will be given, we are using bulletproofs for that, as prover is giving multiple proofs, verifier will use the batch verification and verification complexity is: $\{2m+ 2+ h(2\log(m)+5)\}$ many exponentiation and $m\cdot h$ many multiplication, where $h=s+l-1$.
	\item $\sum\limits_{j'\in [h]} T_{j'k}d_{j'}=\oq[k]$ $\forall k\in Q$: $t\cdot h$ many exponentiations
	\item $\langle e_j,U[i,.,k] \rangle=U[i,j,k]$ $\forall i\in [p], j\in Q', k\in Q$: $2m+ 2+ t(\log m +5$) many exponentiations and $t\cdot m$ multiplications.
	\item $\sum\limits_{i\in[p]} r_{ij}(\eta_k)\cdot U[i,j,k] = \oq[k]_j $ $\forall k\in Q, j\in Q'$: Time to compute $r_{ij}(\eta_k) + p\cdot t$ many multiplications. Now we will show that computating $r_{ij}(\cdot)$ will take $\max\{O(|C|^{2/c}), O(|C|^{1-1/c})\}$ on expectation.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Computing $r_{ij}(\eta_k)$}
For this, the Verifier requires to read the whole matrix $\A$, which of size $|C|$. So for a circuit the Verifier will a few computation and later use it to get better complexity.

We know that size of $\A$ is $pml \times pml$.\\
Let $r\in \bbF^{pml}$, then $r$ can be written as $[r[1],\ldots, r[p]]$,
where $$r[i]=
\begin{bmatrix}
r_{i11} & r_{i12} & \ldots & r_{i1l}\\
r_{i21} & r_{i22} & \ldots & r_{i2l}\\
\vdots\\
r_{im1} & r_{im2} & \ldots & r_{iml}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Verifier needs to compute the evalutaions polynomials $r_{ij}(\eta_k)$ $\forall i\in [p], j\in [m], k\in [n]$, where $r_{ij}(\cdot)$ is a polynomial of degree $<l$ such that $r_{ij}(\zeta_k)=r_{ijk}$ $\forall i\in [p],j\in [m],k\in [l]$.\\
This above computation can be viewed as a linear transformation of $r$. Let $\T$ be the linear Transformation(Matrix), such that $r^TT=(r_{ij}(\eta_k))_{i,j,k}$.
Then we can consider $\T$ as a matrix of dimension $pml\times pmn$ and as $\T$ transforms each row of $r$, which is of size $l$ to a row of size $n$, so the structure of $\T$ is block diagonal, where $\T$ has $pm$ many blocks with each each block of size $l\times n$.\\
$\A$ has at most 3 non-zero entries in each row.\\
\textbf{Claim:} $\AT$ has at most $pml \times 3n$ non-zero entries.\\
Consider the $i^{th}$ row of $\A$, it has total $|C|$ many entries (including zeros and non-zeros), this can be partitioned into $pm$ many portions where each portion is of length $l$. let us enumarate it as $s_1,\ldots, s_{pm}$.\\
Now if any entry of $s_j$ is non-zero, then due to that entry, $j^{th}$ block out of the $pm$ blocks of $\T$ will get multiplied and remain non-zero. So, one non-zero entry of of $s_j$ can create $n$ non-zero entries in the product matrix $\AT$.\\
Now if all the non-zero entries of the $i^{th}$ row of $\A$ are in different $s_j$'s, therefore the product matrix $\AT$ can have at most $3n$ many non-zero entries as $i^{th}$ row of $\A$ can have at most 3 non-zero entries.\\
Let, $B$ be the $``Bad"$ parameter, i.e. If a column of $\AT$ contains more than $B$ non-zero entries call that column a $``Bad"$ column. So, number of possible $``Bad"$ column is $< \frac{3n|C|}{B}$.\\
Therefore probability that a randomly chosen column is $``Bad"= \frac{3n}{B}$.\\
So, for a randomly chosen column of $\AT$, $A\cdot T[j]$, time to compute $r^T(A\cdot T[j])$, is dependent on the number of non-zero entries in $A\cdot T[j]$.\\
So if $A\cdot T[j]$ is a $``Bad"$ column then the time is bounded above by $|C|$, otherwise i.e. $A\cdot T[j]$ is not $``Bad"$, is bounded above by $B$.\\
So, expected time for the above computation is bounded by $\frac{3n}{B}\cdot |C|+ (1-\frac{3n}{B})B$.
Set, $B=|C|^{1-1/c}$, $n=|C|^{1/c}$\\
Expected computation $< \frac{3|C|^{1+1/c}}{|C|^{1-1/c}} + |C|^{1-1/c} - 3|C|^{1/c} = 3|C|^{2/c} + |C|^{1-1/c} - 3|C|^{1/c}$.\\
So for, $c > 2$ expected verifier's complexity is sublinear.
