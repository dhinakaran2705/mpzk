\section{Amortized Verifier's complexity:}

For our construction, verifier's complexity for Interleaved Testing and Quadratic Testing is already sublinear, main bottle-neck for verifier's complexity is due to linear check, where the Verifier requires to read the whole matrix $\A$, which of size $|C|$. So for a circuit the Verifier will a few computation and later use it to get better complexity.

We know that size of $\A$ is $pml \times pml$.\\
Let $r\in \bbF^{pml}$, then $r$ can be written as $[r[1],\ldots, r[p]]$,
where $$r[i]=
\begin{bmatrix}
r_{i11} & r_{i12} & \ldots & r_{i1l}\\
r_{i21} & r_{i22} & \ldots & r_{i2l}\\
\vdots\\
r_{im1} & r_{im2} & \ldots & r_{iml}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Verifier needs to compute the evalutaions polynomials $r_{ij}(\eta_k)$ $\forall i\in [p], j\in [m], k\in [n]$, where $r_{ij}(\cdot)$ is a polynomial of degree $<l$ such that $r_{ij}(\zeta_k)=r_{ijk}$ $\forall i\in [p],j\in [m],k\in [l]$.\\
This above computation can be viewed as a linear transformation of $r$. Let $\T$ be the linear Transformation(Matrix), such that $r^TT=(r_{ij}(\eta_k))_{i,j,k}$.
Then we can consider $\T$ as a matrix of dimension $pml\times pmn$ and as $\T$ transforms each row of $r$, which is of size $l$ to a row of size $n$, so the structure of $\T$ is block diagonal, where $\T$ has $pm$ many blocks with each each block of size $l\times n$.\\
$\A$ has at most 3 non-zero entries in each row.\\
\textbf{Claim:} $\AT$ has at most $pml \times 3n$ non-zero entries.\\
Consider the $i^{th}$ row of $\A$, it has total $|C|$ many entries (including zeros and non-zeros), this can be partitioned into $pm$ many portions where each portion is of length $l$. let us enumarate it as $s_1,\ldots, s_{pm}$.\\
Now if any entry of $s_j$ is non-zero, then due to that entry, $j^{th}$ block out of the $pm$ blocks of $\T$ will get multiplied and remain non-zero. So, one non-zero entry of of $s_j$ can create $n$ non-zero entries in the product matrix $\AT$.\\
Now if all the non-zero entries of the $i^{th}$ row of $\A$ are in different $s_j$'s, therefore the product matrix $\AT$ can have at most $3n$ many non-zero entries as $i^{th}$ row of $\A$ can have at most 3 non-zero entries.\\
Let, $B$ be the $``Bad"$ parameter, i.e. If a column of $\AT$ contains more than $B$ non-zero entries call that column a $``Bad"$ column. So, number of possible $``Bad"$ column is $< \frac{3n|C|}{B}$.\\
Therefore probability that a randomly chosen column is $``Bad"= \frac{3n}{B}$.\\
So, for a randomly chosen column of $\AT$, $A\cdot T[j]$, time to compute $r^T(A\cdot T[j])$, is dependent on the number of non-zero entries in $A\cdot T[j]$.\\
So if $A\cdot T[j]$ is a $``Bad"$ column then the time is bounded above by $|C|$, otherwise i.e. $A\cdot T[j]$ is not $``Bad"$, is bounded above by $B$.\\
So, expected time for the above computation is bounded by $\frac{3n}{B}\cdot |C|+ (1-\frac{3n}{B})B$.
Set, $B=|C|^{1-1/c}$, $n=|C|^{1/c}$\\
Expected computation $< \frac{3|C|^{1+1/c}}{|C|^{1-1/c}} + |C|^{1-1/c} - 3|C|^{1/c} = 3|C|^{2/c} + |C|^{1-1/c} - 3|C|^{1/c}$.\\
So for, $c > 2$ expected verifier's complexity is sublinear.
