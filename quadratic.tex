\subsection{Quadratic Check Protocol}\label{sec:quadcheck}
We now describe the IPCP which allows a prover to prove knowledge of vectors
$\wit_x$, $\wit_y$ and $\wit_z$ in $\FF^N$, satisfying $\wit_x\circ \wit_y =
\wit_z$. As before we view $\wit_x, \wit_y$ and $\wit_z$ as $p \times m \times s$ matrices, where $N=pms$. 
As described previously in Sections ~\ref{sec:witencoding} and ~\ref{sec:construct_oracle}, the prover obtains encodings $\ewit_a \leftarrow \enc(\wit_a)$ and corresponding 
commitments $\comoracle_a \leftarrow \comm(\ewit_a)$ $\forall a\in \{x,y,z\}$. The prover
sets up the oracles $\pi_a := \comoracle_a$ for $a\in \{x,y,z\}$. For a query $Q$,
the verifier is provided the columns $\pi_a[\cdot,k]$ for $a\in \{x,y,z\}$ and $k\in Q$. 
Here we consider oracle as consisting of three sub-oracles for simplicity of description. For
concrete efficiency, $\wit_x$, $\wit_y$ and $\wit_z$ can be encoded together, and the oracle
access can be provided to the combined encoding. We will defer this optimization till the 
discussion on concrete efficiency. The full protocol appears in Figure ~\ref{fig:quadcheck}. 

%Once again, the protocol requires the prover to construct encodings
%$\ewit_x=\enc(\wit_x)$, $\ewit_y=\enc(\wit_y)$ and $\ewit_z=\enc(\wit_z)$ as
%described in Section \ref{sec:witencoding}. Thereafter, the prover uses
%commitment scheme $\comm$ to commit to these encodings as $\comoracle_x =
%\comm(\ewit_x)$, $\comoracle_y = \comm(\ewit_y)$ and $\comoracle_z = \comm(\ewit_z)$. 
%The prover forms the oracle $\pi\in \GG^{3p\times n}$ by vertically stacking the
%$p\times n$ matrices $\comoracle_x,\comoracle_y$ and $\comoracle_z$. As before,
%for a query $Q\subseteq [n]$, the oracle answers with columns $\pi[\cdot,k]$ for
%$k\in Q$. The columns returned by the oracle can be parsed into constituent columns 
%$\comoracle_x[\cdot,k]$, $\comoracle_y[\cdot,k]$ and $\comoracle_z[\cdot,k]$
%canonically. We again discuss the key ingredients of the protocol.

\noindent{\em Reduction to Inner Product}: Let $Q^i_x,Q^i_y$ and $Q^i_z, i\in [p]$ be the
polynomials interpolating the $i^{th}$ slices of $\wit_x$, $\wit_y$ and $\wit_z$ respectively.
Then for vectors $\wit_x,\wit_y,\wit_z$ satisfying
$\wit_x\circ \wit_y=\wit_z$, the polynomials $Q^i=Q^i_x\cdot Q^i_y - Q^z_i$ interpolate
$\bm{0}^{m\times s}$ on the set $\{(\alpha_j,\zeta_k):j\in [m],k\in [s]\}$ for all $i\in [p]$. 
This can be probabilistically
checked by checking that the polynomial $F := \sum_{i\in [p]}r_iQ^i$ interpolates
$\bm{0}^{m\times s}$ on the same set for randomly sampled $r\in \FF^p$. 
To check that $F$ interpolates $\bm{0}^{m\times s}$ on the points
$\{(\alpha_j,\zeta_k)\}_{j\in [m],k\in [s]}$, the verifier checks that
$p(\cdot) := \sum_{j\in [m]}\gamma_jF(\alpha_j,\cdot)$ interpolates $\bm{0}^s$ on
$\overline{\bm{\zeta}}$ for randomly sampled $\gamma=(\gamma_1,\ldots,\gamma_m)\in \FF^m$.
Again, the verifier checks $p(\overline{\bm{\zeta}})=\bm{0}^s$ via the inner product
check $\innp{\tau}{p(\overline{\bm{\zeta}})}=0$ for a random $\tau\in \FF^s$. 

\noindent{\em Intermediate Commitment:} As in the linear check protocol, we
construct $h\times n$ matrix $P$ which serves as a bridge between the oracles
$\pi_a$ $\forall a \in \{x,y,z\}$ and the vector $p(\overline{\bm{\zeta}})$.
For $j\in [h]$, let $p_j(\cdot)$ denote the polynomial $\sum_{i\in[p]}
r_iQ^i(\alpha_j, \cdot)$. We define the matrix $P$ by $P[j,k]= p_j(\eta_k)$ for
$j\in[h], k\in[n]$. The matrix $P$ is in the product code $\rsc{\eta}{n,2\ell-1}\otimes \rsc{\alpha}{h,2m-1}$. As
before we commit to $P$ by committing to the submatrix $\overline{P}$
consisting of the first $2m-1$ rows and the first $2\ell-1$ columns of $P$. Let
$c_1,\ldots,c_{2\ell-1}$ be the commitments to the columns of $\overline{P}$.


\noindent{\em Consistency of $P$ and $p(\overline{\bm{\zeta}})$:} Same as the linear check, only differences are here $p(\cdot) = \sum_{j\in[m]}p_j(\cdot)$ is a polynomial of degree $<2\ell$-1, $\Phi$ is a $s \times 2\ell -1$ matrix that takes $p(\etabar)$ to $p(\zetabar)$, where $p(\etabar) = [p(\eta_1),\ldots, p(\eta_{2\ell-1})]$ and $p(\zetabar) = [p(\zeta_1),\ldots, p(\zeta_{s})]$.  
Proceeding as in the linear check protocol, the inner product finally reduces to
$\innp{[\gamma||0^{m-1}]^T}{z}$, where $z= \beta P_0 + \overline{P}\times
\varphi$ and $P_0\in \FF^{2m-1}$ is a random vector such that $P_0[j]=0$ for
$j\in [m]$, and $\varphi = \Phi\times \tau$. Commitment $c_0$ of $P_0$ is sent to the verifier apriori. Therefore, commitment to $z$ is $\cm = c_0^{\beta}\prod_{k=1}^{2\ell-1}(c_k)^{\varphi_k}$.

\begin{comment} 
Let$\overline{\bm{\eta}}$ denote the vector $(\eta_1, \ldots, \eta_{2\ell})$, and
let $\Phi$ denote the $s\times 2\ell$ matrix such that
$p(\overline{\bm{\zeta}}) = \Phi p(\overline{\bm{\eta}})$. Observe
that $p(\overline{\bm{\eta}}) = \overline{P}^T [\gamma||0^m]^T$ and thus
$p(\zetabar) = \Phi \overline{P}^T [\gamma||0^m]^T$. Now we have
$\innp{\tau}{p(\zetabar)} = p(\zetabar)^T \tau = [\gamma||0^m] \overline{P}
\Phi^T \tau = \innp{[\gamma||0^m]^T}{\overline{P}\varphi}$ where $\varphi =
\Phi^T \tau$. Given commitments $c_1, \ldots, c_{2\ell}$, the commitment to
$\overline{P}\varphi$ can be computed as $\cm = \prod_{k\in[2\ell]} (c_k)^{\varphi_k}$. Using an inner product argument the prover can show that the commitment
$\cm$ opens to vector $z$ such that $\innp{[\gamma||0^m]^T}{z} = 0$. Binding
property of the commitment ensures that $z = \overline{P}\varphi$ with
overwhelming probability.
As in the linear check, the prover uses a random vector $P_0\in \FF^{2m}$ such
that $P_0[j]=0$ for $j\in [m]$ to blind the vector $\overline{P}\varphi$. The
prover initially commits to $P_0$ by sending a commitment $c_0$ to it, and later
sends uses the vector $z=\beta P_0 + \overline{P}\varphi$ in the preceeding
inner product check.
\end{comment}

\noindent{\em Consistency of the oracles and  $P$:} 
As in the linear check, the verifier checks
the consistency at randomly sampled positions $Q=\{(j_u,k_u) : u\in[t] \}
\subset [h]\times[n]$. It queries the oracles for the columns
$\pi_a[\cdot, k_u]$ for $a\in \{x,y,z\}$ and $u\in [t]$. 
Then it queries the prover for vectors $X_u = \ewit_x[\cdot,j_u,k_u], Y_u =
\ewit_y[\cdot, j_u,k_u], Z_u = \ewit_z[\cdot,j_u,k_u]$ for $u\in [t]$. Let
$f_u$ denote the unit vector in $\FF^h$ with $1$ in the $j_u^{th}$ position. The
prover and the verifier run inner product arguments to establish the following: 

\begin{enumerate}[{\rm 1.}]
	\item $\innp{f_u}{P[\cdot,k_u]} = \sum_{i\in[p]} r_i[X_u[i]\cdot Y_u[i]
- Z_u[i]]$ for $u\in[t]$. It can be seen that the identity holds for honestly
computed $P$ and honest vectors $X_u,Y_u$ and $Z_u$. The inner product may be 
verified using an inner product protocol as described in Section ~\ref{sec:matrixcommitment}.
	
	\item $\innp{f_u}{\ewit_x[i,\cdot,k_u]} = X_u[i]$, $\innp{f_u}{\ewit_y[i,\cdot,k_u]}=Y_u[i]$ and $\innp{f_u}{\ewit_z[i,\cdot,k_u]}=Z_u[i]$. These inner products check the consistency of the vectors sent by the prover with the respective oracles. These can be verified in a similar manner to that in the linear check protocol. 
\end{enumerate}

\noindent{\em Proximity Check for Oracle:} We combine the proximity check for the three 
encodings $\ewit_x,\ewit_y$ and $\ewit_z$. The verifier sends a vector
$\rho\sample \FF^{3p}$ and asks the verifier to commit to the matrix
$\tilde{U}=\sum_{i=1}^p[\rho_i\ewit_x[i,\cdot,\cdot]+
\rho_{p+i}\ewit_y[i,\cdot,\cdot]+\rho_{2p+i}\ewit_z[i,\cdot,\cdot]]$
by sending commitments $\tilde{\bm{c}}=(\tilde{c}_1,\ldots,\tilde{c}_\ell)$. Thereafter, for
$u\in [t]$, the verifier checks: 
{\small
\begin{align}\label{eq:combinedproximity}
\prod_{a\in[\ell]} (\tilde{c}_a)^{\Lambda_1^T[a,k_u]} = \prod_{i=1}^{p} (\pi_x[i,k_u])^{\rho_i}\cdot (\pi_y[i,k_u])^{\rho_{p+i}}\cdot(\pi_z[i,k_u])^{\rho_{2p+i}}
%\innph{\Lambda_1[k_u,\cdot]}{\tilde{\bm{c}}}=
%\innph{\rho}{\pi_x[\cdot,k_u]\,||\,\pi_y[\cdot,k_u]\,||\,\pi_z[\cdot,k_u]}.
\end{align}
}


%As in the linear check protocol, using $p(\overline{\bm{\zeta}})=\Phi p(\overline{\bm{\eta}})$, we get the following inner product check
%$\innp{(\gamma,0^{h-m})}{\overline{P}\varphi}=0$ where $\varphi=\Phi^T\tau$. 
%Once again, we
%ask the prover to ``commit'' to $F$ using a tamper resistant structure, like a codeword,
%which enables the verifier to check the aforementioned condition, as well as to
%ensure that the commitment is consistent with oracle replies and prior
%messages.
%\noindent{\em Reduction to Inner Products}: 
%The prover computes 
%$h\times n$ matrix $P$ given by $P[j,k]=F(\alpha_j,\eta_k)$. 

%It commits to $P$ using commitments $(c_1,\ldots,c_{2\ell})$ to the first $2\ell$ columns of $P$.
%Note that each row of $P$ commits to univariate component polynomials
%$F(\alpha_j,\cdot)$ of $F$ via their evaluations of $\bm{\eta}$. 
%Again, the verifier checks $p(\overline{\bm{\zeta}})=\bm{0}^s$ via the inner product
%check $\innp{\tau}{p(\overline{\bm{\zeta}})}=0$ for a random $\tau\in \FF^s$. As in the
%linear check protocol, using $p(\overline{\bm{\zeta}})=\Phi p(\overline{\bm{\eta}})$, we
%get the following inner product check
%$\innp{(\gamma,0^{h-m})}{\overline{P}\varphi}=0$ where $\varphi=\Phi^T\tau$. 
%The commitment to the vector $\overline{P}\varphi$ can be homomorphically computed
%from $c_1,\ldots,c_{2\ell}$.

%\noindent{\em Checking consistency with Oracle}: As in the linear check, the
%verifier uniformly and independently samples $(j_u,k_u)\in [h]\times [n]$ for
%$u\in [t]$, and queries the oracle $\pi$ for columns $\pi[\cdot,k_u]$. Let
%$\pi_x[\cdot,k_u]$, $\pi_y[\cdot,k_u]$ and $\pi_z[\cdot,k_u]$ denote the parse
%of $\pi[\cdot,k_u]$ into commitments corresponding to $\ewit_x,\ewit_y$ and
%$\ewit_z$ respectively. Further, the verifier asks prover for vectors
%$\ewit_x[\cdot,j_u,k_u]$, $\ewit_y[\cdot,j_u,k_u]$ and $\ewit_z[\cdot,j_u,k_u]$
%for $u\in [t]$. The verifier then checks the following:
%\begin{enumerate}[{\rm (i)}]
%\item For all $u\in [t]$: $P[j_u,k_u]=\sum_{i\in
%[p]}r_i(\ewit_x[i,j_u,k_u]\cdot\ewit_y[i,j_u,k_u]-\ewit_z[i,j_u,k_u])$.
%\item Checks that vectors $\ewit_x[\cdot,j_u,k_u]$ are consistent with
%commitments $\pi_x[\cdot,k_u]$ as in linear check protocol. Similar checks are
%made for $\ewit_y[\cdot,j_u,k_u]$ and $\ewit_z[\cdot,j_u,k_u]$.
%\end{enumerate}
%We present the full protocol in Figure \ref{fig:quadcheck}. The completeness of
%the protocol can again be verified by direct calculation. We state the soundness
%of the protocol below:
