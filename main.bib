	abstract="Verifiable computation allows a client to outsource computations to a worker with a cryptographic proof of correctness of the result that can be verified faster than performing the computation. Recently, the highly efficient Pinocchio system was introduced as a major leap towards practical verifiable computation. Unfortunately, Pinocchio and other efficient verifiable computation systems require the client to disclose the inputs to the worker, which is undesirable for sensitive inputs. To solve this problem, we propose Trinocchio: a system that distributes Pinocchio to three (or more) workers, that each individually do not learn which inputs they are computing on. We fully exploit the almost linear structure of Pinochhio proofs, letting each worker essentially perform the work for a single Pinocchio proof; verification by the client remains the same. Moreover, we extend Trinocchio to enable joint computation with multiple mutually distrusting inputters and outputters and still very fast verification. We show the feasibility of our approach by analysing the performance of an implementation in a case study.",

Abstract = {One of the approaches to constructing zero knowledge (ZK) arguments relies on ``PCP techniques'' that date back to influential works from the early 1990's [Babai et al., Arora et al. 1991-2]. These techniques require only minimal cryptographic assumptions, namely, the existence of a family of collision-resistant hash functions [Kilian, STOC 1992], and achieve two remarkable properties: (i) all messages generated by the verifier are public random coins, and (ii) total verification time is merely poly-logarithmic in the time needed to na{\"\i}vely execute the computation being verified [Babai et al., STOC 1991].},

Given commitments to matrices over a finite field, we give a sub-linear size zero-knowledge argument that one committed matrix is the product of two other committed matrices. We also offer a sub-linear size zero-knowledge argument for a committed matrix being equal to the Hadamard product of two other committed matrices. Armed with these tools we can give many other sub-linear size zero-knowledge arguments, for instance for a committed matrix being upper or lower triangular, a committed matrix being the inverse of another committed matrix, or a committed matrix being a permutation of another committed matrix.},
