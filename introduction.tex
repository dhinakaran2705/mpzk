\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
In a zero-knowledge proof protocol, a verifier tries to verify that an instance $x$ is in a language $L$. A prover with a witness $w$ to $x \in L$ tries to convince the verifier on this without revealing any additional information to the verifier than what he already knows. Be it proving that a user is single-spending a coin that he has earned before in a private manner \cite{zerocash} or validating sensitive web browser data reported during telemetry \cite{MozillaPrio}, ZK protocols have garnered immense interest over the last few years. Still in the dream of a decentralized world, there are multiple co-opetitive entities interacting with each other to obtain insights and maximize their goals. A desirable goal is to enable these mutually distrusting entities to prove a predicate on their joint data. But, the traditional \textit{single-prover} ZK setting is restrictive here since there is a single prover holding the entire witness required to prove the predicate. 
\pdnote{do we want to motivate it in a way such that the honest prover setting we are looking at will suffice for the listed applications}
In this work, we study the general setting of \textit{distributed prover zero-knowledge protocols} ($\DPZK$) where multiple co-opetitive i.e., collaborating but mutually distrusting entities each possessing their own secret data want to prove to a verifier that their secret data together satisfies a predicate of common interest. This is done without revealing any information about their sensitive data to each other or to the verifier, more than what each of them know about it beforehand. Some real-world applications follow:
\begin{itemize}
\item A simple but pertinent scenario is of a \textit{joint loan application} by an association of companies from a particular industry. The loan issuer has a set of financial requirements that it wants the association to satisfy, but there is no single trusted entity to act as the prover whom all the companies are willing to provide their sensitive business information with.
\item In cryptocurrency settings \cite{bitcoin, ethereum, zcash}, this would enable a \textit{multi-wallet transaction} or a \textit{proof of joint stake}, which in turn enables secure collaboration applications by design on a blockchain network. % use it for joint auction-
\item In trade logistics business networks \cite{scbn, e2open, tradelens}, a major reason for businesses to enter these networks is to benefit from cross-industry statistics. Publishing these statistics in a publicly verifiable manner without having a single trusted entity is another embodiment of this setting.
\end{itemize}

In abstract terms, we have multiple provers $P_1, \ldots, P_{\Num}$ respectively possessing witnesses $\wit_1, \ldots, \wit_{\Num}$. For a predicate $C$ from the supported class of predicates $\cC$, the provers want to prove to a verifier that $C(w_1,\cdots,w_{\Num}) = 1$.
A natural solution for distributed proof generation is to start with the prover algorithm from a single prover protocol and run this algorithm between multiple provers using multi-party computation (MPC). Pedersen \cite{Ped92} proposed this notion and discussed this generic construction using MPC.
%Each round of proof generation is implemented by an MPC among the provers to generate the message to be sent to the verifier.
The generic construction is optimal in proof size and verifier complexity in that it retains these complexities from the single-prover version irrespective of the number of provers. But, the complexity of proof generation suffers when the single prover protocol is not constructed with distributed proof generation in mind. Even an optimal $R$-round proof generation algorithm with $O(N)$ multiplicative complexity of the prover's computation  might result in a distributed proof generation algorithm with $\Omega(R \cdot N)$ communication among the provers.
Prior works have improved the complexity of distributed proof generation $o(R \cdot N)$, but only when considering simple predicates involved in threshold signatures \cite{DDS} and some sigma protocols \cite{EfficientTZ}, or when working with a weaker adversarial model \cite{trinocchio}.

The goal of this work is to study zero-knowledge protocols supporting \textit{arbitrary} predicates where the proof generation algorithm is ``MPC-friendly''. %The proof generation algorithm is usually measured for efficiency in terms of number of group operations and number of rounds of interaction with the verifier.
Our work first identifies complexity measures that a ZK protocol should optimize for to admit efficient distributed proof generation. We then construct a ZK protocol which is the state-of-art in these parameters.

\subsection{Efficiency parameters for $\DPZK$}
Our discussion will focus on honest-verifier protocols with a transparent setup, though most of this would also apply to protocols with a trusted setup. %producing a fixed or an updatable structured reference strings (SRS).
In the single-prover setting, the efficiency of a proof generation algorithm is usually measured in terms of the number of group operations i.e., the \textit{proof generation computation complexity} $\prcomm$. The number of \textit{zero-knowledge rounds ($\zkrounds$)} of interaction between the prover and the verifier is also considered an efficiency parameter when a non-interactive prover is obtained from its interactive version in a provably secure manner \cite{BCS16}. But, these parameters do not capture the core bottleneck in the setting of multiple provers. 
For instance, Spartan \cite{spartan} has a very efficient proof generation algorithm, but due to the high multiplicative complexity of proof generation its straightforward distributed version requires $O(N^2)$ MPC multiplications where $N$ is the number of gates in the circuit representation of the predicate being proved. %Similar arguments will be made in a future section for the other state-of-art protocols like Aurora \cite{aurora}, Bulletproofs \cite{bulletproofs}. \dnote{mention the asymptotics in the above claims}

As a first step in our work, we identify parameters with significant impact in distributed proof generation. 
As indicated earlier, the first parameter of interest is \textit{proof generation communication}. This quantifies the amount of communication between the provers during the distributed proof generation. In general, this grows linearly with the circuit complexity of the proof generation algorithm for the practical MPC protocols. 
%\dnote{I am saying "practical" because there are RAM based protocols which do better than circuit complexity of the algorithm.}
But, there could also exist MPC protocols where the communication is only dependent on the number of cross-multiplications i.e., the multiplications between the witness bits from different parties.%, since an affine function over the witnesses and a multiplication between witness bits from the same prover can be computed without any interaction in a secret-sharing based MPC.

The next parameter of interest is the number of \textit{proof generation rounds ($\prrounds$)} which indicates the number of rounds of communication between the provers during the distributed proof generation. In a typical MPC, this parameter would be a constant number for the garbled-circuit based protocols and be the cross-multiplicative depth of the circuit for the secret-sharing based protocols. But in our setting, it is also relevant whether or not the MPC protocol transcends across the multiple $\zkrounds$. For each round of the interaction between the provers and the verifier, the provers have to compute their message for that round, in clear, to be sent to the verifier. Thus, even a garbled-circuit MPC based approach for distributed proof generation might result in $\prrounds$ be linear the number of $\zkrounds$, and hence not a constant with respect to the size of the instance unless $\zkrounds$ is also a constant.
\dnote{The above point makes sense only for the interactive version. Should we also argue for non-interactive proof generation too?}
This parameter is also of cryptographic interest. If there is more than one round of prover message generation which requires MPC, care has to be taken to ensure a secure composition of the individual MPCs to prove the complete protocol secure.

\subsection{Circuit share complexity}
Consider a predicate where the witness is \textit{partitioned} among the provers in the $\DPZK$ setting. We define a additional notion of efficiency for distributed proof generation which would be prominent for a class of real-world applications.
Let \textit{shared circuit} denote the part of the circuit representing the predicate whose wire values are functions of inputs from more than one prover. 
We introduce the notion of \textit{circuit share complexity} to denote the size of this shared circuit.
Consider the class of applications where hashes (or any other commitment) of data from different parties are stored on a blockchain and a zero-knowledge proof has to be generated on an aggregation of all the data. This could be: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Finance network: different bank account holders proving to a loan provider that the sum of their account balances is greater than the required threshold.
\item Trade logistic network: different logistic providers proving to a customer or regulator that the average delay of shipment along a particular route is less than a specified time.
\end{enumerate}
In all the applications in this class, each party participating in the aggregation first proves the \textit{relevance} of his/her data before they all run a protocol to prove the aggregated value on their data together. The proof of relevance involves proving that the data corresponds to a commitment in the blockchain network by proving the knowledge of the opening of a commitment in the blockchain. 
For instance, when using verifying a hash commitment within a proof system which works with circuit representation of the relation, the proofs of relevance i.e. the hash verifications of the individual data take up most of the gates in the circuit. But each such verification rely only on data from a single party. The aggregation does involve data from multiple parties but this step requires a relatively smaller number of gates. Hence, the circuit share complexity is very small for such applications, compared to the total size of the circuit. A DPZK protocol with its complexities proportional to the circuit share complexity instead of the total circuit complexity can attain major savings for such applications.%In general, the compatibility of the commitment with function representation of the proof system plays a part in the above discussion. We will discuss the relevant work on this compatibility in more detail in Section \ref{sec:relatedwork}.
Looking ahead, the complexity of the interaction between the provers in our DPZK protocol will be linear only in the circuit share complexity of the circuit predicate to be proven, and not in the total size of the circuit. 

\subsection{Subtlety in proving zero-knowledge}
Before we delve into our DPZK construction, we would also provide a couple of subtle notes regarding the zero-knowledge property of DPZK protocols. This would shed some light on the rationale for some of the artefacts of DPZK protocols. In an DPZK protocol, the verifier is allowed to collude with a subset of provers to learn the witnesses of the other provers. A strong definition of zero-knowledge should ensure that this collusion does not learn any additional information than what they know before the protocol. Here, one should also consider the number of other provers involved in the proof generation as an additional information. In our protocols, we will allow all the provers to know the total number of provers involved. This will lead to a relaxed definition where a verifier colluding with a prover will additionally learn the total number of provers. This still does not let a standalone verifier learn the total number of provers during its interaction with the provers.

This subtle note also impacts the size of the oracles for the protocols in the IOP framework \cite{aurora, ligero}. The oracle and the answers to the oracle queries should be independent of the total number of provers. Hence, for the IOP-based protocols, the efficiency parameters discussed above should be optimized not only for the prover message generation but also for the oracle generation and the query answering.\footnote{In principle, generating the oracle or answering a query would form a part of the prover message generation when IOP is viewed in the lens of an arbitrary interactive protocol.}
The IOP-based protocols in the literature \cite{aurora, ligero} market their non-use of public-key cryptography and thus a potential post-quantum security feature. To achieve zero-knowledge in the distributed prover setting while retaining these features, at a high level, they have to incur the additional overhead in $\prcomm$ due to using information-theoretic MPC to also construct the oracle and answer oracle queries. %, in addition to using it for generating the prover messages.

Another subtle point here is that a single-prover ZK protocol provides the zero-knowledge property only for honest provers. The witness is not guaranteed to be hidden from the verifier if a prover deviates from the protocol. Hence, in a distributed prover setting it is non-trivial to prove or even define the zero-knowledge property if some of the provers deviate from the protocol or if they do not have the valid witness. We take these into account while defining the notion of $\DPZK$ and when constructing our $\DPZK$ protocol.

\subsection{\name{}: a DPZK protocol with linear cross-multiplications and one MPC round}
A bulk of the contribution of our work is an MPC-friendly single-prover protocol \name{} with $\prcomm$ linear in circuit size and a constant number of $\prrounds$.  
%This linear $\prComm$ is due to linear number of cross-multiplications which can be done concurrently, and hence the MPC is only performed on an $N$ mult-gates circuit of depth 1. 
\name{} achieves these properties while achieving proof size and verification complexity competitive with the state-of-art zero-knowledge protocols which do not admit efficient distributed proof generation. In particular, \name{} achieves a proof size of $O(N^{1/c})$ for arbitrary $c\geq 2$, and a verification complexity of $O(N^{1-2/c})$ public key operations and $O(N)$ field operations. \name{} achieves the zero-knowledge property while supporting a threat model of choice - semi-honest/malicious and threshold - to be plugged in for the provers.

%\subsection*{Distributed proof generation}
%--- Informal notion of Distributed Provers Zero Knowledge Protocol $\innp{\Pi}{\verifier}$--- 
%
%A na\"ive approach to build a $\DPZK$ protocol is to take a single-prover ZK protocol and execute a multi-party computation among the provers of each message to be generated by the prover in the single-prover protocol. This satisfies the required security properties, but suffers in concrete efficiency when MPC is used over the proof generation as a black box. 
%
%\subsubsection*{Need for homomorphic commitments} 
%(Oracle access for IOP).
%The (non-interactive) zero-knowledge proof generation protocols based on the Interactive oracle proofs (IOP) or the Interactive PCP (IPCP) paradigms make use of \textit{oracles}. The prover establishes an oracle based on her witness. Once established, the IOP/IPCP protocols ensure that a prover will not modify the oracle further in the protocol. The verifier queries the oracle later in the protocol to verify some the claims made by the prover. When IOP/IPCP based proof systems are converted into the non-interactive setting, the establishment of the oracle is done by producing a commitment to the oracle entries.
%
%We will now run through a mental experiment on achieving distributed proof generation following the blueprint of the single-prover proof generation algorithm. We desire to not have the proof length depend on the number of parties. As we would discuss in depth later, we would also avoid running an MPC protocol on the proof generation circuit(s) of some zero-knowledge protocol. This would trivially, in theory, satisfy our goals, but it would be very inefficient in practice. The way we satisfy these goals for the establishment of the oracle is by requiring the oracle entries and their commitments satisfy homomorphic properties.
%\dnote{self: Sounds somewhat weak. Make it more compelling.}
%
%\subsection*{Technical summary}
%We will now provide a high-level summary of our work and along the way mention our core ideas.
%
%%Our contributions are two-fold: first in defining and constructing a zero-knowledge protocol with distributed proof generation and the second in proposing the first protocol with (expected) sub-linear verifier complexity.
%
%Our main contribution is defining and constructinf a zero-knowledge protocol with distributed proof generation.
%
%\paragraph{DPZK}
%We design a framework for constructing DPZK protocols starting from a single-prover ZK protocol.
%%To construct our DPZK protocol \name{} we follow the strategy of designing a (public coin honest verifier) single-prover ZK protocol whose proofs are ``aggregatable'' at minimal cost. 
%Let the parties $\prover_1, \ldots, \prover_{\Num}$ hold their respective witnesses $\wit_1, \ldots, \wit_{\Num}$ to the relation $R(\stmt, (\wit_1, \ldots,\wit_{\Num}))$. 
%Starting with a (public coin honest verifier) single-prover ZK protocol, there are two steps involved in our proof generation.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The first step involves performing a secret sharing based MPC protocol on $R$ between the provers. As a result, each prover obtains her share of the extended witness, which includes all the wires (correspondingly variables) of a circuit (correspondingly R1CS) representation of R. 
%\item Next, for each message from the prover to the verifier, the parties perform the following two steps:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The parties run an MPC protocol to obtain their share of the message. This step has a major implication on the efficiency of distributed proof generation. Depending on the single-prover protocol, some messages already posses homomorphism properties. Hence, the output of a local run of the single-prover algorithm for this round on a prover's shares of extended witness is already her share of the message in the distributed proof generation. When the message is not homomorphic, we design custom efficient protocols to obtain the shares of the message.
%\item One of the prover parties or an external entity trusted with the correctness of execution is chosen as an ``aggregator''. Aggregator is not trusted with the privacy of the inputs. The aggregator receives the shares of the messages from all the parties and performs the steps of the single-prover protocol to be performed with the aggregated message. Also, a prover acting as an aggregator does not have an incentive to deviate from executing the correct protocol during this step. This is because she could have caused the protocol to abort in any of the previous steps, and there is no additional information that she gains in the intermediate steps that aids her deviation in the aggregation step.
%\end{itemize}
%\end{itemize}
%
%Starting with the single-prover protocol of \cite{ours}, we design custom protocols so that the only additional interaction between the parties during the second step involves MPC for $\intpartofC$ concurrent multiplications, where $\intpartofC$ is the number of wires in the \textit{interactive} part of the circuit. Consider the check $x+y \stackrel{?}{=} z$ when given their respective hashes. If the inputs are present with three different parties, the corresponding circuit for the hash check followed by the addition and equality check involves extensive local computations for the hash before the interaction happens. \dnote{self: Provide a compelling real world use-case here} The additional communication complexity of our $\DPZK$ protocol grows only with the size of the interactive part. To enable this, we do.... start with \cite{ours} --- arrange the rows accordingly in the witness matrix --- 
%
%proof size independent of number of parties --- Oracle queries outputs should be independent of the number of parties --- we do it having parties generate a homomorphic oracle starting with their shares on the extended witness --- we would achieve indistinguishability between proof generated in a distributed manner and the proof generated by a single party ---
%In this, we use homomorphic commitments --- we follow from \cite{ours} ---

%Let $P$ be the predicate that is being proved. An aggregation of multiple proofs on the same $P$ produces a proof.  Let us consider the interactive version of the protocol. A proof consists of the messages sent by the prover to the verifier and, additionally in IOPs, the replies to the oracle queries of the verifier.
%where each message from the prover is first identified whether it is homomorphic or not. If
