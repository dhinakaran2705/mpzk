\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
In a zero-knowledge proof protocol, a verifier tries to verify that an instance $x$ is in a language $L$. A prover with a witness $w$ to $x \in L$ tries to convince the verifier on this without revealing any additional information to the verifier than what he already knows. Be it proving that a user is single-spending a coin that he has earned before in a private manner \cite{Zcash} or validating sensitive web browser data reported during telemetry \cite{MozillaPrio}, ZK protocols have garnered immense interest over the last few years. Still in the dream of a decentralized world, there are multiple co-opetitive entities interacting with each other to obtain insights and maximize their goals. A desirable goal is to enable these mutually distrusting entities to prove a predicate on their joint data. The traditional ZK setting is restrictive here since there is a single prover holding the entire witness required to prove the predicate. 

In this work, we study the general setting where multiple co-opetitive i.e., collaborating but mutually distrusting entities each possessing their own secret data want to prove to a verifier that their secret data together satisfies a predicate of common interest. This is done without revealing any information about their sensitive data to each other, more than what they know about it beforehand.

In abstract terms, we have multiple provers $P_1, \ldots, P_p$ respectively possessing witnesses $w_1, \ldots, w_p$. For a predicate $C$ from the supported class of predicates $\cC$, the provers want to prove to a verifier that $C(w_1,\cdots,w_p) = 1$.

A natural solution for distributed proof generation is to start with the prover code from a single prover protocol and run this code between multiple provers using multi-party computation. Pedersen \cite{Ped92} proposed this notion and discussed the generic construction using MPC.
%Each round of proof generation is implemented by an MPC among the provers to generate the message to be sent to the verifier.
This generic construction is optimal in proof size and verifier complexity in that it retains these from the single-prover protocol irrespective of the number of parties. But, a naive application of MPC would make the proof generation extremely expensive. \dnote{can we say about the asymptotics here? Or we have to argue only in terms of concrete numbers?} 
Prior works have improved the complexity of distributed proof generation but only when considering simple predicates as in threshold signatures \cite{} and sigma protocols \cite{KMR12}, or when working with a restricted adversarial model \cite{trinocchio}

The goal of this work is to study zero-knowledge protocols supporting \textit{arbitrary} predicates where the proof generation algorithm is ``MPC-friendly''. We will focus our discussions on honest-verifier protocols with transparent setup producing common reference strings (CRS), though most of our discussions would also apply to protocols with a trusted setup producing a fixed or an updatable structured reference strings (SRS).
In a single-prover setting, the efficiency of a proof generation algorithm is usually measured in terms of the number of group operations. Additionally, the number of rounds of interaction between prover and verifier is also considered an efficiency parameter when starting with an interactive protocol and obtaining a non-interactive prover from it in a provably secure manner \cite{BCS16}. But, these parameters do not capture the core bottleneck in the setting of multiple provers. For instance, Spartan \cite{spartan} has a very efficient proof generation algorithm, but due to the high multiplicative complexity of proof generation its distributed version performs $O(N^2)$ MPC multiplications where $N$ is the number of gates in the circuit representation of the predicate involved. Similar arguments will be made in a future section for the other state-of-art protocols like Aurora \cite{aurora}, Bulletproofs \cite{bulletproofs}.
\dnote{mention the asymptotics in the above claims}

The first part of our work is to identify parameters of significant impact in distributed proof generation. 
As indicated earlier, the first parameter of interest is \textit{multiplicative complexity} of the proof generation process. The complexity of an MPC protocol would grow with this parameter. More specifically, the parameter of interest would be multiplicative complexity of witnesses from different parties. Since an affine function over the witnesses can be computed without any interaction
\dnote{fine tune the last two sentences. currently, they allude to secret-sharing based MPC. Is it okay for me to include a separate sentence to capture GC based MPC protocols?}

In a multi-round interactive protocol, the next parameter of interest is the number of rounds which require interactive MPC i.e., the number of rounds which require a multiplication of witness bits from different parties. \dnote{can we say anything non-trivial here from the NI-MPC literature?}
This parameter is also of interest in cryptographic terms, not just for efficiency. If there is more than one round of prover message generation which require MPC care has to be taken to ensure a secure composition of the individual MPCs to prove the complete protocol secure.
Bulletproofs \cite{bulletproofs} requires MPC to be performed for each round of prover message generation.

In all these protocols, the verifier can collude with a subset of provers to learn the witnesses of the other provers. A subtle point to note here is that the strongest notion of zero-knowledge should ensure that the collusion of the verifier and a subset of provers should not be able to learn about the number of other provers involved in the proof generation. \dnote{is it even feasible to get this notion?!} In our definition, we will relax it slightly to allow all the provers know the total number of provers involved. This implies that a verifier colluding with a prover will learn the total number of provers. But, a standalone verifier should still be not able to learn the number of provers from the messages that he receives.

This subtle point also impacts the size of the oracles for the protocols in the IOP framework \cite{Aurora, Ligero}. The size of the oracle and hence the answers to the oracle queries would have to be independent of the number of provers. Hence, for the IOP protocols, the discussed parameters have to be optimized for oracle generation and query answering.\footnote{In principle, generating the oracle or answering a query  would form a part of the prover message generation when IOP is viewed in the lens of an arbitrary interactive protocol.}
We then study the existing single-prover protocols in the light of these parameters. 

Our main contribution then is to propose a single-prover protocol which achieves the best efficiency for all these parameters among the state-of-art protocols. ---Start here---


their models avoid communication among the provers - but it is necessary(???) when proving a general class of predicates?
Difference in definition when involving multiple rounds with more than one round involving communication among provers -- the input to provers in Round i+1 is a function of protocol execution from previous rounds.

\subsection{Overview}
--- Overview of our work: the notion, techniques.--- 
--- define the notion of distributed proof generation--- 
--- provide a protocol which satisfies these notions

\subsection*{Distributed proof generation}
--- Informal notion of Distributed Provers Zero Knowledge Protocol $\innp{\Pi}{\verifier}$--- 

A na\"ive approach to build a $\DPZK$ protocol is to take a single-prover ZK protocol and execute a multi-party computation among the provers of each message to be generated by the prover in the single-prover protocol. This satisfies the required security properties, but suffers in concrete efficiency when MPC is used over the proof generation as a black box. 

\subsubsection*{Need for homomorphic commitments} 
(Oracle access for IOP).
The (non-interactive) zero-knowledge proof generation protocols based on the Interactive oracle proofs (IOP) or the Interactive PCP (IPCP) paradigms make use of \textit{oracles}. The prover establishes an oracle based on her witness. Once established, the IOP/IPCP protocols ensure that a prover will not modify the oracle further in the protocol. The verifier queries the oracle later in the protocol to verify some the claims made by the prover. When IOP/IPCP based proof systems are converted into the non-interactive setting, the establishment of the oracle is done by producing a commitment to the oracle entries.

We will now run through a mental experiment on achieving distributed proof generation following the blueprint of the single-prover proof generation algorithm. We desire to not have the proof length depend on the number of parties. As we would discuss in depth later, we would also avoid running an MPC protocol on the proof generation circuit(s) of some zero-knowledge protocol. This would trivially, in theory, satisfy our goals, but it would be very inefficient in practice. The way we satisfy these goals for the establishment of the oracle is by requiring the oracle entries and their commitments satisfy homomorphic properties.
\dnote{self: Sounds somewhat weak. Make it more compelling.}

\subsection*{Technical summary}
We will now provide a high-level summary of our work and along the way mention our core ideas.

%Our contributions are two-fold: first in defining and constructing a zero-knowledge protocol with distributed proof generation and the second in proposing the first protocol with (expected) sub-linear verifier complexity.

Our main contribution is defining and constructinf a zero-knowledge protocol with distributed proof generation.

\paragraph{DPZK}
We design a framework for constructing DPZK protocols starting from a single-prover ZK protocol.
%To construct our DPZK protocol \name{} we follow the strategy of designing a (public coin honest verifier) single-prover ZK protocol whose proofs are ``aggregatable'' at minimal cost. 
Let the parties $\prover_1, \ldots, \prover_{\Num}$ hold their respective witnesses $\wit_1, \ldots, \wit_{\Num}$ to the relation $R(\stmt, (\wit_1, \ldots,\wit_{\Num}))$. 
Starting with a (public coin honest verifier) single-prover ZK protocol, there are two steps involved in our proof generation.
\begin{itemize}
\item The first step involves performing a secret sharing based MPC protocol on $R$ between the provers. As a result, each prover obtains her share of the extended witness, which includes all the wires (correspondingly variables) of a circuit (correspondingly R1CS) representation of R. 
\item Next, for each message from the prover to the verifier, the parties perform the following two steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item The parties run an MPC protocol to obtain their share of the message. This step has a major implication on the efficiency of distributed proof generation. Depending on the single-prover protocol, some messages already posses homomorphism properties. Hence, the output of a local run of the single-prover algorithm for this round on a prover's shares of extended witness is already her share of the message in the distributed proof generation. When the message is not homomorphic, we design custom efficient protocols to obtain the shares of the message.
\item One of the prover parties or an external entity trusted with the correctness of execution is chosen as an ``aggregator''. Aggregator is not trusted with the privacy of the inputs. The aggregator receives the shares of the messages from all the parties and performs the steps of the single-prover protocol to be performed with the aggregated message. Also, a prover acting as an aggregator does not have an incentive to deviate from executing the correct protocol during this step. This is because she could have caused the protocol to abort in any of the previous steps, and there is no additional information that she gains in the intermediate steps that aids her deviation in the aggregation step.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Starting with the single-prover protocol of \cite{ours}, we design custom protocols so that the only additional interaction between the parties during the second step involves MPC for $\intpartofC$ concurrent multiplications, where $\intpartofC$ is the number of wires in the \textit{interactive} part of the circuit. Consider the check $x+y \stackrel{?}{=} z$ when given their respective hashes. If the inputs are present with three different parties, the corresponding circuit for the hash check followed by the addition and equality check involves extensive local computations for the hash before the interaction happens. \dnote{self: Provide a compelling real world use-case here} The additional communication complexity of our $\DPZK$ protocol grows only with the size of the interactive part. To enable this, we do.... start with \cite{ours} --- arrange the rows accordingly in the witness matrix --- 

proof size independent of number of parties --- Oracle queries outputs should be independent of the number of parties --- we do it having parties generate a homomorphic oracle starting with their shares on the extended witness --- we would achieve indistinguishability between proof generated in a distributed manner and the proof generated by a single party ---
In this, we use homomorphic commitments --- we follow from \cite{ours} ---

%Let $P$ be the predicate that is being proved. An aggregation of multiple proofs on the same $P$ produces a proof.  Let us consider the interactive version of the protocol. A proof consists of the messages sent by the prover to the verifier and, additionally in IOPs, the replies to the oracle queries of the verifier.
