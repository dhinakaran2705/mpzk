\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
In a zero-knowledge proof protocol, a verifier tries to verify that an instance $x$ is in a language $L$, and a prover with a witness $w$ to $x \in L$ tries to convince the verifier on this without revealing any additional information to the verifier than what he already knows. Be it proving that a user is spending a coin that he has earned before, or a shipping container proving the timeliness of its delivery along a particular route, ZK protocols have garnered immense interest over the last few years and has become a basic building for private and decentralized world. Still in the dream of a decentralized world, the powerful applications have multiple co-opetitive entities interacting with each other to obtain insights and maximize their goals. The traditional ZK protocol is restrictive here since there is a single prover holding the witness. In this work, we study the general setting where multiple co-opetitive entities each possessing their own secret data want to prove to a verifier that their secret data together satisfies a predicate of common interest. In abstract terms, we have multiple provers $P_1,\ldots,P_p$ respectively possessing witnesses $w_1, \ldots, w_p$. For a predicate $C$ from the supported class of predicates $\cC$, the provers want to prove to a verifier that $C(w_1,\cdots,w_p) = 1$.

The notion of distributed proof generation was first studied by Pedersen \cite{PedThesis}.
He provides a construction where each round of proof generation is implemented by an MPC among the provers to generate the message to be sent to the verifier.
This generic construction is optimal in proof size and verifier complexity in that it retains those off the single-prover protocol irrespective of the number of parties. But, the prover complexity will be extremely high unless the single-prover protocol is ``MPC-friendly''. 
\dnote{can we say about the asymptotics here? Or can we argue only in terms of concrete numbers?} 

In this work, we will study single-prover zero-knowledge protocols where the proof generation algorithm is MPC-friendly while supporting arbitrary predicates. %We will focus on honest-verifier zero-knowledge protocols
In an interactive zero-knowledge protocol, the efficiency of a proof generation algorithm is usually measured in terms of the number of group operations. When applying a transformation \cite{BCS16} to obtain a non-interactive version of the protocol in a provably secure manner, the number of rounds of interaction between prover and verifier also impact the efficiency. 
The first part of this work has been in identifying other parameters that heavily impact the complexity of proof generation. 
In BCS or in Fiat-Shamir heuristic, the commitment has to be compact, the generation of which requires MPC.
The multiplicative complexity of the prover message generation increases the MPC complexity of that round of proof generation.
Also, the number of rounds which do not have the message generation to be an affine function on the extended witness also impact the complexity.
%But, the literature till now studies instantiations for signatures \cite{} and sigma protocols \cite{KMR12}

We then study the existing single-prover protocols in the light of these parameters. 

Then, our main contribution, a single-prover protocol which achieves ??? efficiency for all these parameters.


The class of threshold signatures \cite{Ped} and sigma protocols \cite{KMR12}

their models avoid communication among the provers - but it is necessary(???) when proving a general class of predicates?
Difference in definition when involving multiple rounds with more than one round involving communication among provers -- the input to provers in Round i+1 is a function of protocol execution from previous rounds.

\subsection{Overview}
--- Overview of our work: the notion, techniques.--- 
--- define the notion of distributed proof generation--- 
--- provide a protocol which satisfies these notions

\subsection*{Distributed proof generation}
--- Informal notion of Distributed Provers Zero Knowledge Protocol $\innp{\Pi}{\verifier}$--- 

A na\"ive approach to build a $\DPZK$ protocol is to take a single-prover ZK protocol and execute a multi-party computation among the provers of each message to be generated by the prover in the single-prover protocol. This satisfies the required security properties, but suffers in concrete efficiency when MPC is used over the proof generation as a black box. 

\subsubsection*{Need for homomorphic commitments} 
(Oracle access for IOP).
The (non-interactive) zero-knowledge proof generation protocols based on the Interactive oracle proofs (IOP) or the Interactive PCP (IPCP) paradigms make use of \textit{oracles}. The prover establishes an oracle based on her witness. Once established, the IOP/IPCP protocols ensure that a prover will not modify the oracle further in the protocol. The verifier queries the oracle later in the protocol to verify some the claims made by the prover. When IOP/IPCP based proof systems are converted into the non-interactive setting, the establishment of the oracle is done by producing a commitment to the oracle entries.

We will now run through a mental experiment on achieving distributed proof generation following the blueprint of the single-prover proof generation algorithm. We desire to not have the proof length depend on the number of parties. As we would discuss in depth later, we would also avoid running an MPC protocol on the proof generation circuit(s) of some zero-knowledge protocol. This would trivially, in theory, satisfy our goals, but it would be very inefficient in practice. The way we satisfy these goals for the establishment of the oracle is by requiring the oracle entries and their commitments satisfy homomorphic properties.
\dnote{self: Sounds somewhat weak. Make it more compelling.}

\subsection*{Technical summary}
We will now provide a high-level summary of our work and along the way mention our core ideas.

%Our contributions are two-fold: first in defining and constructing a zero-knowledge protocol with distributed proof generation and the second in proposing the first protocol with (expected) sub-linear verifier complexity.

Our main contribution is defining and constructinf a zero-knowledge protocol with distributed proof generation.

\paragraph{DPZK}
We design a framework for constructing DPZK protocols starting from a single-prover ZK protocol.
%To construct our DPZK protocol \name{} we follow the strategy of designing a (public coin honest verifier) single-prover ZK protocol whose proofs are ``aggregatable'' at minimal cost. 
Let the parties $\prover_1, \ldots, \prover_{\Num}$ hold their respective witnesses $\wit_1, \ldots, \wit_{\Num}$ to the relation $R(\stmt, (\wit_1, \ldots,\wit_{\Num}))$. 
Starting with a (public coin honest verifier) single-prover ZK protocol, there are two steps involved in our proof generation.
\begin{itemize}
\item The first step involves performing a secret sharing based MPC protocol on $R$ between the provers. As a result, each prover obtains her share of the extended witness, which includes all the wires (correspondingly variables) of a circuit (correspondingly R1CS) representation of R. 
\item Next, for each message from the prover to the verifier, the parties perform the following two steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item The parties run an MPC protocol to obtain their share of the message. This step has a major implication on the efficiency of distributed proof generation. Depending on the single-prover protocol, some messages already posses homomorphism properties. Hence, the output of a local run of the single-prover algorithm for this round on a prover's shares of extended witness is already her share of the message in the distributed proof generation. When the message is not homomorphic, we design custom efficient protocols to obtain the shares of the message.
\item One of the prover parties or an external entity trusted with the correctness of execution is chosen as an ``aggregator''. Aggregator is not trusted with the privacy of the inputs. The aggregator receives the shares of the messages from all the parties and performs the steps of the single-prover protocol to be performed with the aggregated message. Also, a prover acting as an aggregator does not have an incentive to deviate from executing the correct protocol during this step. This is because she could have caused the protocol to abort in any of the previous steps, and there is no additional information that she gains in the intermediate steps that aids her deviation in the aggregation step.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Starting with the single-prover protocol of \cite{ours}, we design custom protocols so that the only additional interaction between the parties during the second step involves MPC for $\intpartofC$ concurrent multiplications, where $\intpartofC$ is the number of wires in the \textit{interactive} part of the circuit. Consider the check $x+y \stackrel{?}{=} z$ when given their respective hashes. If the inputs are present with three different parties, the corresponding circuit for the hash check followed by the addition and equality check involves extensive local computations for the hash before the interaction happens. \dnote{self: Provide a compelling real world use-case here} The additional communication complexity of our $\DPZK$ protocol grows only with the size of the interactive part. To enable this, we do.... start with \cite{ours} --- arrange the rows accordingly in the witness matrix --- 

proof size independent of number of parties --- Oracle queries outputs should be independent of the number of parties --- we do it having parties generate a homomorphic oracle starting with their shares on the extended witness --- we would achieve indistinguishability between proof generated in a distributed manner and the proof generated by a single party ---
In this, we use homomorphic commitments --- we follow from \cite{ours} ---

%Let $P$ be the predicate that is being proved. An aggregation of multiple proofs on the same $P$ produces a proof.  Let us consider the interactive version of the protocol. A proof consists of the messages sent by the prover to the verifier and, additionally in IOPs, the replies to the oracle queries of the verifier.
